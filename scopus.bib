abstract={Manufacturing industries frequently encounter production scheduling problems containing device dynamic reconfiguration processes (DRP). DRP refers to dynamic device adjustments (such as replacement of tools), leading to changes in the devices’ actual processing time. It has a severe impact on the production schedule. Nevertheless, there is scarcely research upon hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (HFSP) with DRP. Besides, it is necessary to consider multiple conflict objectives in the HFSP. Thus, the multi-objective HFSP with DRP (MOHFSP-DRP) is significant in both theoretical research and application. This paper first proposes a multi-objective mathematical model (MOHFSP-DRP) that simultaneously considers the DRP and devices’ adjustable processing modes. The bi-objective of this model is to minimize both the makespan and the whole device's energy consumption. This study then proposes an improved multi-objective whale optimization algorithm (IMOWOA) to solve the MOHFSP-DRP and obtain the Pareto-based optimal solution set. After that, to verify the proposed method's effectiveness, numerical experiments are implemented based on the real-world cases in a Chinese company's digital hot-rolling workshop. Results denote that the presented IMOWOA is superior to SPEA2 and NSGA-II. Finally, the MOHFSP-DRP model and IMOWOA are applied to a real-world hot-rolling shop successfully. The real-world cases verify the proposed IMOWOA can tackle the presented MOHFSP-DRP very well. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We consider a two-stage production scheduling problem where each operation can be outsourced or processed in-house. For each operation in the same machine, the ratio of its outsourcing cost to its processing time is constant. The objective is to minimize the sum of the makespan and the total outsourcing cost. It is known that this problem is either polynomial time solvable or NP-hard according to the conditions of the ratios. Even though approximation algorithms for NP-hard cases had been developed, their tight worst-case performance ratios are still open. In this paper, we carefully analyze the approximation algorithms to identify their tight worst-case performance ratios for cases. In one case, we propose a new approximation algorithm with a better and tight worst-case performance ratio. In the process of analyzing the algorithm, we propose a technique utilizing nonlinear optimization. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Digital Twin (DT) is considered a key approach to enhance the system reactivity to uncertain events due to its ability to getting data from the field and triggering actions on the physical asset. Given the modern technological and rapidly changing work environment, it is likely that in the next years companies will need to retrofit their manufacturing systems by integrating DTs. In this context, it is fundamental to define the necessary steps for the development of DTs and for their integration into manufacturing systems through a DT architecture. In response to this issue, a methodology based on Virtual Commissioning is proposed. A stepwise approach is illustrated in which the DT is designed, integrated and verified using a virtual environment. The methodology is validated through the integration of a DT into a flow shop for the implementation of a scheduling reactive to machine breakdown. By following the steps of the proposed methodology, a DT architecture able to improve the makespan of the studied flow shop is developed, suggesting the potential applicability of the approach to industrial manufacturing systems. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={As the world environment is faced with the severe challenge of global warming, prefabricated construction is the path for the construction industry towards green production. Precast component manufacturers produce standardized and non-standardized components simultaneously. Non-standard components are produced make-to-order (MTO). Standard components are produced make-to-stock (MTS). In this study, the flow shop precast component production scheduling problem under a hybrid MTO-MTS environment is studied. A hybrid MTO-MTS precast component flow shop production model is developed. The object is to minimize total tardiness and earliness of delivery. An iterative job insertion algorithm based on whale optimization is developed. The proposed method involves two stages: scheduling and insertion. The first is to optimize the scheduling of customized MTO components. Then the standard MTS job is inserted. Through the computational evaluation, the performance and effect of the proposed approach are tested. It can conclude that the proposed algorithm contributes to the effective and efficient optimization of Hybrid MTO-MTS precast component production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Precast production scheduling is a key issue in prefabricated construction. Process connection and blocking are two characteristics of the flowshop production of precast components; however, they have received little attention in research on production scheduling, which may prevent actual production from following optimized scheduling schemes. In this study, an optimization model for the production scheduling of precast components was established considering process connection and blocking for minimizing the total penalty cost of earliness and tardiness. A solution for the model was designed and applied to a practical case for validation. The results indicate that the improved scheduling scheme can reduce the penalty cost and facilitate on-time delivery of precast components under two scenarios: tardiness partially allowed and no tardiness allowed. The proposed model and method can help precast plants to improve efficiency and reduce cost in addition to enhancing the practicality of precast production scheduling schemes. © 2021},

abstract={The joint optimization of production scheduling and maintenance planning has a significant influence on production continuity and machine reliability. However, limited research considers preventive maintenance (PM) and corrective maintenance (CM) in assembly permutation flow shop scheduling. This paper addresses the bi-objective joint optimization of both PM and CM costs in assembly permutation flow shop scheduling. We also propose a new mixed integer linear programming model for the minimization of the makespan and maintenance costs. Two lemmas are inferred to relax the expected number of failures and CM cost to make the model linear. A restarted iterated Pareto greedy (RIPG) algorithm is applied to solve the problem by including a new evaluation of the solutions, based on a PM strategy. The RIPG algorithm makes use of novel bi-objective-oriented greedy and referenced local search phases to find non-dominated solutions. Three types of experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed MILP model and the performance of the RIPG algorithm. In the first experiment, the MILP model is solved with an epsilon-constraint method, showing the effectiveness of the MILP model in small-scale instances. In the remaining two experiments, the RIPG algorithm shows its superiority for all the instances with respect to four well-known multi-objective metaheuristics. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

abstract={Research on scheduling problems is an evergreen challenge for industrial engineers. The growth of digital technologies opens the possibility to collect and analyze great amount of field data in real-time, representing a precious opportunity for an improved scheduling activity. Thus, scheduling under uncertain scenarios may benefit from the possibility to grasp the current operating conditions of the industrial equipment in real-time and take them into account when elaborating the best production schedules. To this end, the article proposes a proof-of-concept of a simheuristics framework for robust scheduling applied to a Flow Shop Scheduling Problem. The framework is composed of genetic algorithms for schedule optimization and discrete event simulation and is synchronized with the field through a Digital Twin (DT) that employs an Equipment Prognostics and Health Management (EPHM) module. The contribution of the EPHM module inside the DT-based framework is the real time computation of the failure probability of the equipment, with data-driven statistical models that take sensor data from the field as input. The viability of the framework is demonstrated in a flow shop application in a laboratory environment. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={This paper proposes a production scheduling procedure for the production lines of a printed circuit board company. Linearity features of the manufacturing process of this company are characterized and exploited for developing an efficient three-phase scheduling procedure. The production line is formulated as a linear job shop that resembles a flow shop. First, the N-gram modelling approach is adopted to analyse the data sets to detect the machines that would be candidates of the bottleneck in the production lines. Second, according to the candidates, the bottleneck data are extracted from the original data sets and solved as flow shops by a mixed integer programming model. The optimal solutions of the bottleneck flow shop is next extended by incorporating upstream and down stream operations to form approximate solutions of the original problems. We propose three different strategies for forming the approximate solutions and the best one is designated as the final solution. The performance of the proposed heuristic algorithm is tested and compared with the well-known NEH algorithm through numerical instances from real production lines. Statistics indicate that for most instances including up to 80 jobs the proposed method delivers competitive solutions within a much shorter time than the NEH algorithm. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This study presents a heuristic formulation of the flow shop scheduling problem by the hybrid algorithm fitness function. The genetic algorithm is used to model the time-estimates such as makespan and completion time. This paper aims to optimize the sequence-independent and sequence-dependent time-estimates. The production scheduling parameters such as permutation, non-permutation, no-wait, tardiness, and several workstations are identified from a piston manufacturing industry, in Northern India. Different machine operating parameters were collected from the piston manufacturing industry to work on reducing the makespan. The MATLAB programming in heuristics algorithm distribution function resulted in a reduction of makespan of the product by five times. The reduced completion time is 23 minutes for the piston ring product and 26 minutes in the cumulative validation of the proposed model. The cumulative optimized standard error of 0.26; (n=3) simulate and synthesize the suggested model with its validation. The system efficiency through completion time optimization ranged from 70-82 percent in piston ring, and 63-89 percent in cumulative validation of the model has been worked out for each machine type. The data generated through system optimization helps the scientific world and entrepreneurs in the advancement of sequence-based transportation. © 2021 Scientific Publishers. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The energy consumption loss is high particularly in manufacturing processes involving heating furnaces. Moreover, the mandatory constraints in continuous heating stage bring difficult challenges to production scheduling. To improve the production efficiency and reduce the energy consumption in a hybrid flow shop with continuous and discrete processing stages, this study developed an adaptive selection multi-objective optimization algorithm with preference (ASMOAP). The mandatory constraints of continuous processing stage are transformed into one of the optimization objectives, which is defined as maximum excess value of adjustment time in this paper. A multi-objective optimization scheduling model with the makespan, energy consumption, and maximum excess of adjustment time is established. The optimization preference is designed in the proposed multi-objective optimization algorithm. The maximum excess of adjustment time is set as the multi-objective optimization preference. Three adaptive selection strategies are designed for the algorithm based on the proportions of outstanding and preference individuals to eliminate constraint conflicts. Presented results prove that the proposed algorithm could effectively solve hybrid flow shop scheduling problem considering discrete and continuous processing stages with limited time. It can be applied to obtain a better feasible solution while improving the efficiency and reducing the energy consumed in practical production processes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The increasing number of prefabrication projects has increased the demand for precast concrete (PC) components. The production cost of PC components significantly affects the development of the precast industry and the progress of prefabrication projects. To reduce the production cost, both the delivery delay time and component storage time must be reduced. Flow-arrangement optimization is generally performed using the genetic algorithm. However, this method cannot always yield a perfect optimal solution. Moreover, the traditional optimization model does not consider the impact of the overtime hours of workers on the project costs. In this study, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model was developed to optimize the production scheduling by minimizing the storage and delay times. The total delay time for the components was reduced by 55.3%, from 3.8 to 1.7 h, and the total storage time for finished components was reduced by 20.3%, from 6.4 to 5.1 h. Then, the use of the MILP model was extended to optimize the production scheduling by minimizing overtime. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of MILP were verified by comparing the results. The total overtime decreased by approximately 24.5%, from 11.5 to 9.3 h. It has been demonstrated that the proposed MILP model can achieve a better production sequence with less overtime. The findings of this research can be deployed in optimizing efficiency in the real-life scheduling of production sequence. © 2021 Zhansheng Liu et al.},

abstract={An iterated greedy algorithm (IGA) is a simple and powerful heuristic algorithm. It is widely used to solve flow-shop scheduling problems (FSPs), an important branch of production scheduling problems. IGA was first developed to solve an FSP in 2007. Since then, various FSPs have been tackled by using IGA-based methods, including basic IGA, its variants, and hybrid algorithms with IGA integrated. Up until now, over 100 articles related to this field have been published. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing tutorial or review paper of IGA. Thus, we focus on FSPs and provide a tutorial and comprehensive literature review of IGA-based methods. First, we introduce a framework of basic IGA and give an example to clearly show its procedure. To help researchers and engineers learn and apply IGA to their FSPs, we provide an open platform to collect and share related materials. Then, we make classifications of the solved FSPs according to their scheduling scenarios, objective functions, and constraints. Next, we classify and introduce the specific methods and strategies used in each phase of IGA for FSPs. Besides, we summarize IGA variants and hybrid algorithms with IGA integrated, respectively. Finally, we discuss the current IGA-based methods and already-solved FSP instances, as well as some important future research directions according to their deficiency and open issues. IEEE},

abstract={The permutation flow shop scheduling problem (PFSSP) is a typical production scheduling problem and it has been proved to be a nondeterministic polynomial (NP-hard) problem when its scale is larger than 3. The whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is a new swarm intelligence algorithm which performs well for PFSSP. But the stability is still low, and the optimization results are not too good. On this basis, we optimize the parameters of WOA through chaos theory, and put forward a chaotic whale algorithm (CWA). Firstly, in this paper, the proposed CWA is combined with Nawaz–Ensco–Ham (NEH) and largest-rank-value (LRV) rule to initialize the population. Next, chaos theory is applied to WOA algorithm to improve its convergence speed and stability. On this basis, we also use cross operator and reversal-insertion operator to enhance the search ability of the algorithm. Finally, the improved local search algorithm is used to optimize the job sequence to find the minimum makespan. In several experiments, different benchmarks are used to investigate the performance of CWA. The experimental results show that CWA has better performance than other scheduling algorithms. © 2021 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press B.V.},

abstract={This paper proposes a mathematical model for production scheduling, whose objective is to maximize the profits or Throughput of a company in the food sector through a Flexible Hybrid Flow, based on the theory of constraints. Considering the company's production configuration, which is a two-stage hybrid flow line, a mixed integer linear model programming (MILP) was formulated and programmed to adequately represent the real situation. The mathematical model developed in this study that is an easy and effective tool that helps to control the production process, by optimizing the quantities of each product to be produced, as well as establishing the sequence in which they must be carried out, which becomes an advantage against its competitors and also obtain a timely response to the needs of demand and compliance with the commitments made to its customers. The results obtained with the MILP, with reasonable computational times, allow for maximizing profits, considering the constraints of the problem. © 2021 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.},

abstract={Multiple local assignment rules are common in production lines with complex production elements to direct the production process. Different local assignment rules have different degrees of impact on each production evaluation index, which aggravates the conflict between each production evaluation index. In order to solve the problem of increasing conflict among multiple production evaluation indexes in complex production scheduling process, based on the mathematical model of flexible flow shop with limited buffer and public buffer (FFSP-PB), game elements such as game player, game strategy and game order are established according to the idea of multiplayer cooperative game, and design the corresponding game strategy selection method to predict and control the game behavior of each player in the problem. Then a conflict resolution method of production evaluation index based on multiplayer cooperative game is proposed to solve the conflict between multiple production evaluation indexes, and then improve each production evaluation index. Finally, according to the actual production data of a bus manufacturing enterprise based on flexible manufacturing mode, several simulation schemes are designed to analyze and verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method in resolving the conflicts between production evaluation indexes, and provides a reliable new solution for the conflict resolution of production evaluation index in the field of flexible manufacturing. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Production and maintenance tasks apply for access to the same resources. Maintenance-related machine downtime reduces productivity, but the costs incurred due to unplanned machine failures often outweigh the costs associated with predictive maintenance. Costs incurred due to unplanned machine failure include corrective maintenance, reworks, delays in deliveries, breaks in the work of employees and machines. Therefore, scheduling of production and maintenance tasks should be considered jointly. The problem of generating a predictive schedule with given constrains is considered. The objective of the paper is to develop a scheduling method that reflects the operation of the production system and nature of disturbances. The original value of the paper is the development of the method of a basic schedule generation with the application of the Ant Colony Optimisation. A predictive schedule is built by planning the technical inspection of the machine at time of the predicted failure-free time. The numerical simulations are performed for job/flow shop systems. © 2020 by the authors. Li-censee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={With the rising concern of environmental pollution caused by fossil fuels, the energy efficiency becomes a key issue for the energy sensitive company in order to save the electricity cost and take responsibility for the sustainable development. Thus, an effective energy-aware operations management for the manufacturing plant is crucial to improve its competitiveness in the global market nowadays. We propose a mathematical model integrating three interrelated operational aspects including the production, maintenance and energy for the flow shops under Time-of-Use electricity tariff. A two-layer math-heuristic is devised to solve the model efficiently based on the decomposition of decision variables. In the outer layer, the jobs’ sequences and the buffer times are optimized using the metaheuristic based on genetic algorithm. In the inner layer, the maintenances’ positions and machines’ on/off are optimized using the exact method based on dynamic programming algorithm. Compared with CPLEX and traditional GA, the math-heuristic can get the near optimal solution with a small gap for the small-sized problems and perform well for the large-sized problems. The tradeoff between energy cost and makespan shows that more profit can be achieved using our model for the instance with a later production deadline. Finally, numerical experiments are also conducted to analyze the structure of the optimal solution in order to provide the managerial insights. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This research focuses on solving a scheduling problem in a heat treatment line of a multinational steel company. A bi-objective model is proposed to minimize the line total energy costs and total tardiness. The solution is carried out through a matheuristic technique that combines metaheuristics and mathematical programming. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is designed to generate initial solutions to a Multi-objective Variable Neighborhood Search (MOVNS) algorithm. One benefit of this approach is the ability to handle large-scale problems, common in real production scheduling cases, with reasonable computational time and alternative quality planning. The suggested matheuristic is proven to be statistically superior to an only metaheuristic approach, taking as performance metric the final approximated Pareto solutions’ hypervolume. Tests performed with data from the industry showed improvements in the scheduling of the heat treatment line with reductions of energy costs and tardiness up to 13% and 90%, respectively. The methodology can also be extended to other similar scheduling processes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this article, we focus on a joint scheduling problem that considers the corrective maintenance (CM) due to unexpected breakdowns and the scheduled preventive maintenance (PM) in a generic M-machine flow shop. The objective is to find the optimal job sequence and PM schedule such that the total of the tardiness cost, PM cost, and CM cost is minimized. Currently, most existing studies on the PM schedules are based on a fixed PM interval, which is rigid and may lead to poor performance, as the fixed strategy fails to effectively balance the trade-offs between the production scheduling and maintenance. To address this critical research issue, our novel idea is to dynamically update the PM interval based on the real-time machine age, such that the maintenance activity coordinates with the job scheduling to the maximum extent, which results in an overall cost saving. Specifically, a correction factor is introduced to dynamically update the PM interval and to help evaluate whether it is worthwhile to process the job first at the risk of the CM before performing the PM action. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive strategy, simulations and a case study on mining operations are conducted to show that the adaptive strategy outperforms the existing methods with a less total cost. Note to Practitioners - This article is motivated by the critical problem of balancing the trade-offs between production scheduling and maintenance in a flow shop production line, where jobs are processed on the machines in the same route. On the one hand, production scheduling aims to meet the customer demands on time. On the other hand, the maintenance actions help restore the machines' reliability by reducing the machine failure rate. Most existing approaches to scheduling the PM are based on the fixed PM interval, which is rigid and may lead to poor performance. Although the nonperiodic PM interval strategy has been proposed in the literature for production scheduling, it still does not consider the adaptive PM strategy in the context of flow shop scheduling with multiple machines. To fill this literature gap, in this article, we first model a generic M-machine flow shop considering both the CM and PM. Then, we suggest a new adaptive and easy-to-implement approach to dynamically update the PM interval and improve the decision-making on the PM schedules. Compared with the conventional maintenance policy, the adaptive one greatly reduces the total cost in real-time scheduling. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The paper presents the concept of a genetic algorithm for solving the problem of scheduling production processes, in which there are operations requiring the interaction of resources from at least two, different groups of competences. The considered system is based on flexible flow shop and the objective function is associated with minimizing the flow time of tasks. The general schedule generation procedure using the genetic algorithm is presented. Three sub-chromosomes are proposed for describing an individual. First of them represents a precedence feasible order of production tasks. Numbers of parallel machines are coded by the second sub-chromosome of the individual. Numbers of production employees able to execute operation on the set of parallel machines are coded by the third sub-chromosome. The order crossover and shift mutation procedures are described for the proposed chromosome differentiation and selection. Implementation of the developed concept enables parallel planning of positions and human resources (or any groups of resources) and improve practical usability in relation to hierarchical methods of resource planning. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In this paper, production scheduling for rotomoulded plastics manufacturing in a multi-machine environment is considered. The objective is to minimise total tardiness. The problem has some commonality with hybrid flow shop scheduling with batching, where additional constraints are needed to control which machines may be used at each stage. The problem is shown to be NP-hard and is formulated as a mixed integer program. Given consequently large solve times to obtain optimal solutions, simulated annealing and tabu search algorithms were developed alongside a constructive heuristic to obtain near-optimal solutions within a practical time-frame. The solution algorithms were tuned and tested using randomly generated problem instances. The best results in terms of solution quality were generally obtained by simulated annealing. The problem instances were generated to be representative of a real production environment located in Queensland, Australia. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This work studies the integrated production and distribution planning problem (Production-Routing Problem), where the aim is to capture the dependency between the decisions of production, scheduling, inventory and routing. The PRP in this paper is studied in a furniture company that produces different types of products in a Flexible Flow-shop production process. A Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming model is proposed to solve the problem, and then a linearization technique is utilized, taking into consideration the power supply options that include traditional and renewable energy sources. This approach contributes to an optimal utilization for power sources for a sustainable production system. Experimental results are presented and discussed where the objective is to minimize the total costs. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Aimed at the no-idle flow-shop scheduling problem (NIFSP) with minimized makespan, a discrete sine optimization algorithm (DSOA) is proposed. Inspired by sine waveforms, the original sine optimization algorithm (SOA) is a global optimization algorithm, which uses the sine function to update the position of search agents. First, the update position strategy to adapt to the combinatorial optimization problem is redefined. An iterated greedy algorithm with a variable removing size is employed to update the position to enhance the exploration ability. Then, a crossover strategy and a selection strategy are applied to avoid the algorithm falling into local optimum. Next, to improve the exploitation ability of local search and the accuracy of the algorithm, an insertion-based local search scheme is applied in DSOA to search for a better solution around the current optimal solution. Finally, based on the Taillard benchmark, the simulation results of performance comparisons are presented. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DSOA algorithm for solving NIFSP. © 2020, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Press. All right reserved.},

abstract={On-site renewable energy provides great opportunities for manufacturing plants to reduce energy costs when faced with time-varying electricity prices. To efficiently utilize on-site renewable energy generation, production schedules and energy supply decisions need to be well investigated. In this paper, we present a two-stage, multi-objective stochastic program for flow shops with sequence-dependent setup. The first stage provides optimal schedules to minimize the total completion time. The second stage determines the energy supply decisions to minimize energy costs under a time-of-use electricity pricing scheme. The power demand of the production is met by on-site renewable generation, supply from the main grid, and energy storage system. An epsilon-constraint algorithm integrated with L-shaped method is proposed to analyze the problem. Sets of Pareto optimal solutions are provided for decision-makers. Our results show that the energy cost of setup operations is relatively high such that it cannot be ignored. Further, using solar or wind energy saves energy costs significantly. While, utilizing solar energy can reduce more. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper mainly studies the modeling of classical processing workshops with the aim of manufacturing period and no recycling. Based on the optimization of production scheduling of printed circuit boards, an optimization algorithm is proposed. Firstly, aiming at minimizing the work penalty, the integer programming model of the printed circuit board of the single flow shop is established. Then, under the premise of chain priority constraint, by combining the minimum relaxation priority distribution rule and the branch and bound method, a heuristic algorithm with dynamic bottleneck transformation with penalty weights is proposed. Finally, through the simulation experiments of data sets, it is verified that the proposed model and algorithm have certain effects in solving the production scheduling problem of printed circuit boards. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Considering the widely existing uncertainty in the real-world production process, this paper uses fuzzy numbers to represent each job's processing time and each product's assembly time, and constructs a model for the fuzzy distributed assembly permutation flow-shop low-carbon scheduling problem (FDAPFLSP), whose criteria are the minimization of both the fuzzy maximum completion time and the fuzzy total energy consumption. Then, a hybrid cross-entropy algorithm (HCEA) is proposed for solving the FDAPFLSP. Firstly, a practical ranking correction rule of triangular fuzzy number is designed via analyzing the characteristics of the commonly used ranking rules of triangular fuzzy number and considering the basic constraints of the production scheduling problem. Secondly, HCEA adopts variable neighborhood local search with adaptive selection probability, which can efficiently search different regions in solution space and further enhance the performance of the algorithm. Finally, simulations and comparisons demonstrate that HCEA can effectively solve FDAPFLSP. © 2020, Editorial Department of Control Theory & Applications South China University of Technology.

abstract={Steelmaking and the continuous-casting (SCC) scheduling problem is a realistic hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with continuous-casting production at the last stage. This study considers the SCC scheduling problem with diverse products, which is a vital and difficult problem in steel plants. To tackle this problem, this study first presents the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to minimize the objective of makespan. Then, an improved migrating birds optimization algorithm (IMBO) is proposed to tackle this considered NP-hard problem. In the proposed IMBO, several improvements are employed to achieve the proper balance between exploration and exploitation. Specifically, a two-level decoding procedure is designed to achieve feasible solutions; the simulated annealing-based acceptance criterion is employed to ensure the diversity of the population and help the algorithm to escape from being trapped in local optima; a competitive mechanism is developed to emphasize exploitation capacity by searching around the most promising solution space. The computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed IMBO obtains competing performance and it outperforms seven other implemented algorithms in the comparative study. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Production scheduling and maintenance planning are two of the most important tasks that managers face before implementing their decisions on the shop floor. Another issue managers have to keep in mind is the proper allocation of various resources for production. These issues create difficulties in the planning process. In this paper, we propose a bi-objective model that integrates the three aforementioned issues and determines production scheduling, maintenance planning and resource supply rate decisions in order to minimize the make span and total production costs, which include total maintenance, resource consumption and resource inventory costs. Two meta heuristic methods were employed to find approximations of the Pareto optimal front in a permutation flow shop environment: The well-known non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and a bi-objective adaptation of the particle swarm optimization (BOPSO). Additionally, a bi-objective randomized local search (BORLS) heuristic was developed in order to generate multiple non-dominated solutions along its search path. Two sets of computational experiments were conducted. In the first set, the performances of the two meta heuristics with purely random initial populations were compared, with results showing the superiority of BOPSO over NSGA-II. In the second set, the initial populations were enhanced with heuristically generated solutions from BORLS and the performances of BOPSO, NSGA-II and BORLS used as an independent search algorithm, were compared. In this instance, the algorithms performed evenly for large problems, with the BORLS method generating better solutions when total production cost is emphasized. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Production scheduling is of great significance in improving production effectiveness while the energy-efficient problem is one of most concerned problems for researchers and manufacturers. Thus, this study investigates the energy-efficient distributed permutation flow shop scheduling problem (DPFSP) with the objectives of makespan and energy consumption. The DPFSP is an extension of permutation flow shop problem (PFSP) considering a set of identical factories. This paper presents a multi-objective mixed integer programming model based on the three sub-problems: allocating jobs among factories, scheduling the jobs in each factory and determining speed upon each job. A multi-objective whale swarm algorithm (MOWSA) is proposed to solve this energy-efficient DPFSP. A new problem-dependent local search is developed to improve the exploitation capability of MOWSA. Moreover, the updating exploitation mechanism is presented to enhance energy efficiency without affecting production efficiency. Finally, the extensive comparison experiments are designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed MOWSA, problem-dependent local search and updating exploitation mechanism. The results indicate the effectiveness of MOWSA and the superior performance over NSGA-II, SPEA2, PAES and MDEA, and also demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the energy consumption compared with other algorithms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In a factory of automobile component primer painting, various automobile parts are attached to overhead hangers in a conveyor line and undergo a series of coating processes. Thereafter, the components are wrapped at a packaging station. The packaging process should be fully balanced by an appropriate sequence of components to prevent the bottleneck effect because each component requires different packaging times and materials. An overhead hanger has a capacity limit and can hold varying numbers of components depending on the component type. Capacity loss can occur if the hanger capacity is not fully utilized. To increase hanger utilization, companies sometimes mix two or more component types on the same hangers, and these hangers are called mixed hangers. However, mixed hangers generally cause heavy workload because different items require additional setup times during hanging and packing processes. Hence, having many mixed hangers is not recommended. A good production schedule requires a small number of mixed hangers and maximizes hanger utilization and packaging workload balance. We show that the scheduling problem is NP-hard and develop a mathematical programming model and efficient solution approaches for the problem. When applying the methods to solve real problems, we also use an initial solution-generating method that minimizes the mixing cost, set a rule for hanging the items on hangers considering eligibility constraint, and decrease the size of tabu list in proportion to the remaining computational time for assuring intensification in the final iterations of the search. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Numerous optimization problems exist in the product and process design, engineering, and planning, as well as production management, and the evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been proved to be effective optimization methods to solve these problems. However, how to choose the appropriate EA is one of the key issues due to the variety of EAs and lack of experience. Under this circumstance, firstly, a novel EA recommendation system framework is designed and proposed, and the implementation of the EA recommendation method is also described in this paper. Then, computational experiments are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method on the basis of 14 typical benchmark problems and 20 classical EAs. Finally, a case study regarding permutation flow shop scheduling is also carried out to test its effectiveness and accuracy. The proposed recommendation method provides a new way to select the appropriate EAs scientifically and reasonably to solve a given optimization problem. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Shop Floor Control (SFC) is one of the main concepts in Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRPII), and production scheduling is a key element in SFC. This paper studies the hybrid flow shop scheduling problem, where jobs are multiprocessors. The objective is to minimize total completion time. Although there are several papers considering the hybrid flow-shop scheduling problem with multiprocessor tasks, none has proposed a mathematical model for this problem. At first, the two problems (fixed and selective cases) are mathematically formulated by mixed integer linear programming models. By using commercial software, the model is used to solve the small instances of the problems. Moreover, an elephant herding optimization is developed to solve large instances of the problems. To numerically evaluate the proposed algorithm, it is compared with three available algorithms in the literature. © 2020 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.},

abstract={With the growing concern of energy shortage and environment pollution, the energy aware operation management problem has emerged as a hot topic in industrial engineering recently. An integrated model consisting of production scheduling, preventive maintenance (PM) planning, and energy controlling is established for the flow shops with the PM constraint and peak demand constraint. The machine's on/off and the speed level selection are considered to save the energy consumption in this problem. To minimize the makespan and the total energy consumption simultaneously, a multi-objective algorithm founded on NSGA-II is designed to solve the model effectively. The key decision variables are coded into the chromosome, while the others are obtained heuristically using the proposed decoding method when evaluating the chromosome. Numerical experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency by comparing the proposed algorithm and the traditional rules in manufacturing plant. The impacts of constraints on the Pareto frontier are also shown when analyzing the tradeoff between two objectives, which can be used to explicitly assess the energy consumption. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Industrial production scheduling problems are challenges that researchers have been trying to solve for decades. Many practical scheduling problems such as the hybrid flowshop are NP-hard. As a result, researchers resort to metaheuristics to obtain effective and efficient solutions. The traditional design process of metaheuristics is mainly manual, often metaphor-based, biased by previous experience and prone to producing overly tailored methods that only work well on the tested problems and objectives. In this paper, we use an Automatic Algorithm Design (AAD) methodology to eliminate these limitations. AAD is capable of composing algorithms from components with minimal human intervention. We test the proposed AAD for three different optimization objectives in the hybrid flowshop. Comprehensive computational and statistical testing demonstrates that automatically designed algorithms outperform specifically tailored state-of-the-art methods for the tested objectives in most cases. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this paper, a reinforcement learning method is utilized to solve the steel production scheduling problem. Based on characteristics of steel production processing, the model of hybrid flow-shop scheduling problem is constructed. Then the model is attributed to a Markov Decision Process, and corresponding states, actions, reward function are put forward. When trading off the exploration and exploitation, an improved ϵ -greedy policy is designed. Finally, this hybrid flow-shop scheduling model based on reinforcement learning is applied to the scheduling example of steel production processing.

abstract={The smart manufacturing system employs a large number of advanced information technologies, which makes it possible to collect real-time data in production systems. The wide application of various types of information technology in the manufacturing process has enabled the manufacturing system to accumulate a large amount of data relating to production scheduling. Therefore, the historical production scheduling data and the real-time production data collected by smart equipments are used to establish a data-driven production scheduling method. Focusing on real-time hybrid flow shop scheduling problems, a real-time data-driven scheduling method based on the BP neural network is proposed. Firstly, the sample data for scheduling knowledge mining is extracted from the historical optimal and near-optimal scheduling scenarios. Through the BP neural network, the mapping relationship network between the production system state and the dispatching rules is obtained, which is then applied to production online real-time scheduling. Finally, numerical experiments verify that the proposed method outperforms the fixed single dispatching rule, and is stable under different scheduling objectives. © 2020, Editorial Office of Control and Decision.

abstract={Production scheduling is an important research topic widely studied during past few decades. However, many manufacturers still fail to successfully deploy scheduling algorithms and systems, even though information and communication technologies can be used to collect and process data associated with production scheduling under modern smart manufacturing environment. The primary problem is that many scheduling algorithms and systems did not consider diverse variety of scheduling requirements of real production systems. Especially, production schedulers in small make-to-order manufacturers have much trouble in utilizing such algorithms and systems. In order to address this issue, this paper aims to propose a functional architecture of production scheduling system for small make-to-order manufactures under smart manufacturing environment and develop a flexible scheduling algorithm for this system. For illustration, the proposed system and algorithm are applied to a two-machine flow shop scheduling problem, and it is expected that this paper will provide a meaningful insight into the user experiences of production scheduling systems. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Prior studies are lacking which address permutation flow shop scheduling problems and hybrid flow shop scheduling problems together to help firms find the optimized scheduling strategy. The permutation flow shop scheduling problem and hybrid flow shop scheduling problems are important production scheduling types, which widely exist in industrial production fields. This study aimed to acquire the best scheduling strategy for making production plans. An improved fireworks algorithm is proposed to minimize the makespan in the proposed strategies. The proposed improved fireworks algorithm is compared with the fireworks algorithm, and the improvement strategies include the following: (1) A nonlinear radius is introduced and the minimum explosion amplitude is checked to avoid the waste of optimal fireworks; (2) The original Gaussian mutation operator is replaced by a hybrid operator that combines Cauchy and Gaussian mutation to improve the search ability; and (3) An elite group selection strategy is adopted to reduce the computing costs. Two instances from the permutation flow shop scheduling problem and hybrid flow shop scheduling problems were used to evaluate the improved fireworks algorithm's performance, and the computational results demonstrate the improved fireworks algorithm's superiority. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Aiming at the flow shop scheduling problem of reentrant batch discrete machines with periodic annealing furnace as batch processor in seamless steel tube cold drawing production, a bi-objective optimal scheduling model is established, which minimizes the total work completion time and the total energy consumption of batch machines. A multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm, fast non-dominant ranking, congestion comparison and particle mutation operation algorithm are designed. In this algorithm, non-dominant ranking and congestion comparison are used to select the optimal particle and the combination of early and late mutation is used. The experimental results show that, compared with the Variation- Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms and Non-Dominated Sorting Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms, the algorithm finds a better minimum on both objective functions, and the average level of the results is closer to the front of Pareto solution set, which effectively improves the optimization ability of the algorithm. Through Pareto solution, the algorithm can get a set of Pareto solution which comprehensively weighs the completion time and energy consumption of annealing furnace. It can provide a variety of alternative scheduling schemes. When the production time is sufficient, the scheme with lower energy consumption of annealing furnace can be selected as far as possible. When the enterprise has many orders to pursue production efficiency, the scheme with smaller completion time can be selected as far as possible to effectively solve the problem. Such practical problems have been solved. © 2020 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

abstract={The existing production scheduling mode ignores ladle dispatching resulting in the increase of energy consumption in ladle heating and instability in production. Hence, we study the energy-efficient integration optimization of production scheduling and ladle dispatching in this paper. Specifically, a mixed integer linear programming model is formulated to coordinate the time-dependent correlations between them and quantify the energy consumption of them. Moreover, an enhanced migrating birds optimization algorithm (EMBO) is proposed to tackle this NP-hard integration optimization problem. In this proposed algorithm, a three-level rule-based heuristic decoding is designed to achieve the optimal solutions at the given production sequence; well-designed neighborhood structures are appended to intensify exploration; a simulated annealing-based acceptance criterion is hired to escape from local optima. Additionally, a novel competitive mechanism for birds regrouping is developed to increase the population diversity by information exchange between the left and right lines of V-formation. Mass experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EMBO observably outperforms all the compared algorithms, and the proposed integration optimization decreases the energy-consumption by 1.21% in the context of constant production efficiency. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

abstract={Simulation-based optimization methods can support decision-making in industrial Production Planning and Control (PPC) to include energy considerations as part of a multi-objective scheduling problem. In this paper, we investigate a General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) metaheuristic for simulation-based energy-aware production scheduling, including optimization of setup times for thermal processes. The fitness evaluation is based on a hybrid discrete/continuous simulation model that provides assessment of energy costs including time-dependent energy pricing together with other production goals, like storage costs, while also considering dynamic interdependencies between production machinery and building facilities. We demonstrate the method on a case study of flow shop scheduling in an industrial bakery in different scenarios. Comparisons show a potential gain of 6% when considering energy costs as an optimization target within PPC. ©2020 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS)},

abstract={Considering that process planning and production scheduling are independent of each other in a hybrid flow-shop, this study categorizes the process route into parallel process-set, batch set and unordered process-set, and builds a multi-objective optimization model to minimize the maximum completion time and the minimum processing cost. An improved artificial bee colony algorithm has been developed to solve the model. A segmented decoding method based on the insertion principle and the release time of the predecessor process is proposed to effectively use the idle time of the machine. A dynamic triggering neighborhood mechanism is introduced to enhance the local searchabilit of the algorithm. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of this algorithm to solve such problems are verified via simulation experiments. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, a model for integrating production scheduling and maintenance planning is proposed for flow shop production system. The suggested model in this paper is based on the optimal jobs sequence for jobs that will be processed in multiple machines connected in series. The objective of this study is to find the optimal sequence for jobs while reducing the total production and maintenance costs. The model works by generating an initial solution using longest processing time (LPT) dispatching rule. Then, tabu search algorithm is established to obtain the optimal sequence for jobs. Computational experiments are performed on problems with five serially machines which are assigned to process eight diverse jobs from the same product family. The result is compared with the genetic algorithm optimization technique under individual PM scheme for obtaining superior solutions that has been proved in the literature to be one of the best approach. The computational results show that the recommended approach is qualified over the simulation based genetic algorithm optimization technique. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Given the significant proportion of the outsourced parts, components, and the complex assembly structure of the automobiles, agriculture machinery and heavy industry equipment, distributed production and flexible assembly are much-needed production scheduling settings to optimise their global supply chains. This research extends the distributed assembly permutation flowshop scheduling problem to account for flexible assembly and sequence-independent setup times (DPFSP_FAST) in a supply chain-like setting. For this purpose, an original mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation to the DPFSP_FAST problem is first investigated. Considering makespan as the optimisation criterion, constructive heuristic and customised metaheuristic algorithms are then proposed to solve this emerging scheduling extension. Through extensive computational experiments, it is shown that the proposed algorithms outperform the existing best-performing algorithms to solve the DPFSP_FAST problem, yielding the best-found solutions in nearly all of the benchmark instances. Narrowing the gap between theory and practice, this study helps integrate the production planning scheduling across the supply chain. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={A dynamic optimized production scheduling which takes into account demand fluctuation and uncertainty is very critical for the efficient performance of Prefabricated Component Supply Chain. Previous studies consider only the conditions in the production factory and develop corresponding models, ignoring the dynamic demand fluctuation that often occurs at the construction site and its impact on the entire lifecycle of prefabricated construction project. This paper proposes a dynamic flow shop scheduling model for prefabricated components production, which incorporates demand fluctuation such as the advance of due date, insertion of urgent component and order cancellation. An actual prefabrication construction project has been used to validate the proposed multi-objective genetic algorithm model. The experimental results show that the proposed model can achieve a cost saving of up to 43.2%, which shows that the proposed model can cope well with the occurrence of demand fluctuation. This research contributes to the dynamic decision support system for managing prefabricated components. © 2020, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={At present, energy consumption all over the world is increasing, and various approaches to energy issues such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are in progress. In Japanese manufacturing industry, the introduction of factory Energy Management System (EMS) and the improvement of production equipment are being carried out in order to reduce energy consumption. Accordingly similar considerations are also important issues for production scheduling. In this paper, based on the assumption that renewable energy and EMS will eventually be introduced in the future, we focus on factories and utility companies, and at the same time, try to realize a scheduling method that improves energy efficiency with keeping production performance, and evaluate it by computational experiments. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Many optimization algorithms have been proposed to solve hybrid flowshop scheduling problem (HFSP). However, with the development of industry and society, labor right and labor safety have become important problem to consider in production scheduling. So the green HFSP considering makespan, noise and dust pollution becomes an urgent problem to be solved. In this paper, the rider optimization algorithm (ROA) is modified into the multi-objective rider optimization algorithm (MOROA) using Pareto archive and neighborhood sorting techniques. The Pareto archive and neighborhood sorting technology make the Pareto optimal solution set of MOROA have higher coverage and more solutions. Then MOROA is discretized into discrete MOROA (DMOROA) to solve the HFSP considering makespan, noise and dust pollution. DMOROA is tested on 10, 30 and 50 jobs HFSP considering makespan, noise and dust pollution. The test results are compared with two multi-objective algorithms to verify the performance of DMOROA. And the test results verify that the DMOROA is superior to the comparison algorithms in search accuracy, number of non-dominated solutions, diversity of solution set and stability. Therefore, DMOROA is effective in solving multi-objective HFSP considering makespan, noise and dust pollution. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Scheduling is a very complex but important problem in the real world environment applications. Production scheduling with the objective of minimising the makespan is an important task in manufacturing systems. For most scheduling problems studied so far, the processing time of each job on each machine has been assumed as a real number. However in real world applications the processing time is often imprecise which means the processing time may vary dynamically because of some human factor or operating faults. This paper considers an n jobs and m machines flow shop scheduling problem of minimising the makespan. In this work fuzzy numbers are used to represent the processing times in the flow shop scheduling. Fuzzy and neural network-based concepts are applied to the flow shop scheduling problems to determine an optimal job sequence with the objective of minimising the makespan. The performance of our proposed hybrid model is compared with the existing methods selected from different papers. Some problems are solved with the present method and it is found suitable and workable in all the cases. A comparison of our present method with the existing methods is also provided in this work.

abstract={In this paper, the capacitated lot-sizing and scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setups and backlogging with energy consideration is studied. A new mixed-integer programming model is proposed. The planning horizon is split into T periods where each one is characterized by a duration, an allowed maximal power, a price of electricity and power and demands of products. The objective is to find a production scheduling that minimizes the total production cost. As this problem is known to be NP-hard, a Fix-and-Relax heuristic is developed. Computational experiments demonstrate that this method provides good quality results. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Scheduling is defined as the process of allocating resources over time to perform a collection of tasks within a certain period of time. PT KHI Pipe Industries in Cilegon Indonesia, has been producing high quality longitudinal and spiral weld steel pipes. The company uses FCFS (first come first serve) rule for scheduling their jobs, which means that job processing based on the first incoming prioritizes orders. In October 2018 there was delay in their production, namely 1771 pipes are still in work in process (WIP) of total demand is 6, 296 pipes. Based on these problems, this research tries to determine a better production scheduling by getting minimum makespan as scheduling performance. Heuristic and metaheuristic methods used in this research for minimizing the makespan, there are Campbell Dudek Smith (CDS) for heuristic and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for metaheuristic. We also proposed a new heuristic algorithm for this problem. The results show the makespan of each method, there are CDS method: 742.87 hours, PSO method: 711.96 hours, Proposed Heuristic Algorithm method: 694.64 hours, and existing production scheduling of FCFS rules is 746.43 hours. Based on the results, the Proposed Heuristic Algorithm has smaller makespan than the others. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Multi-objective flow shop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times (MOFSP-SDST) is a class of important production scheduling problem with strong industry background. In this paper, a MOFSP-SDST mathematic model with the objectives of total production cost, makespan, mean flow time and mean idle time of machines is developed. To solve this multi-objective model, a novel multi-objective approach based on fuzzy correlation entropy analysis is proposed firstly. In this multi-objective approach, two types of objective function value sequences, namely the referenced function value sequence and comparable function value sequence, are constructed and mapped into two types of fuzzy sets by a modified relative membership function. The fuzzy correlation entropy coefficient between the two types of fuzzy sets is used to select better solutions in a multi-objective problem. A discrete multi-objective fireworks algorithm (DMOFWA) is proposed to address the MOFSP-SDST. In the DMOFWA, a new multi-objective approach is adopted to handle the multiple objectives and guide the search of the algorithm. Two kinds of machine learning strategies are adopted, namely opposition-based learning (OBL) and clustering analysis (CA). The OBL is employed to learn from the current search space and improve the exploration ability of DMOFWA, and the CA based on fuzzy correlation entropy coefficient is proposed to cluster firework individuals. Computational and statistical results show that the novel multi-objective approach, OBL and CA strategies can effectively improve the performance of DMOFWA. Furthermore, the results indicate that DMOFWA performs better than four state-of-the-art comparison algorithms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper presents two multi-objective models that integrate packaging size and production scheduling problems for a flexible flow shop system. The main objective is to find the packaging size of finished product per item and the production schedule that would minimise cost of lost units, unpacking cost, inventory cost, earliness/tardiness penalties and kilograms of carbon dioxide emitted by resources operation. Since the complexity of the proposed models, a Pareto-based hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is also developed. A case study was developed to analyse the performance of both models using different instances. Numerical results indicate that the outperformance of one model over the other depends on the demand and the packaging size. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a scheduling algorithm for on-time production in a hybrid flow shop manufacturing process. The main objective of our proposed algorithm is to schedule the operation of machine so as to maximize the number of machines that substitute the operation of failed machines, while satisfying the maximum allowable production time. To this end, the algorithm maximizes time interval between operations at different stages to maximize the number of substitute machines to be allocated in the time interval. Max-min optimization is employed to achieve the objective of the proposed algorithm. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with that of the algorithm minimizing the makespan of a schedule. Our numerical results show that the proposed algorithm improves the robustness of a manufacturing process prone to machine failure. The performance of the proposed algorithm is about three times as high as that of the algorithm minimizing the makespan in the manufacturing process, where one hundred of jobs are to be processed. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to address the energy-efficient scheduling problems in the hybrid flow shop problem (HFSP) with machine maintenance. For this aim, the mixed integer programming model (MIPM) considering energy consumption and machine maintenance is proposed firstly. Given the NP-hard nature of the model, a hybrid multi-objective algorithm (HMOA) combining an improved algorithm based on the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II-imp) with a heuristic algorithm is developed to solve MIPM. The NSGA-II-imp designs a new elite remained strategy for the purpose of balancing two conflict objectives and a heuristic algorithm is mainly designed to add machine maintenance during production scheduling. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared to GA, SA-GA, NSGA-II separately based on extensive numerical experiments. Results show the effectiveness of the algorithm in this paper. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={An important production planning problem is how to best schedule jobs (or lots) when each job consists of a large number of identical parts. This problem is often approached by breaking each job/lot into sublots (termed lot streaming). When the total number of transfer sublots in lot streaming is large, the computational effort to calculate job completion time can be significant. However, researchers have largely neglected this computation time issue. To provide a practical method for production scheduling for this situation, we propose a method to address the n-job, m-machine, and lot streaming flow-shop scheduling problem. We consider the variable sublot sizes, setup time, and the possibility that transfer sublot sizes may be bounded because of capacity constrained transportation activities. The proposed method has three stages: initial lot splitting, job sequencing optimization with efficient calculation of the makespan/total flow time criterion, and transfer adjustment. Computational experiments are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the three-stage method. The experiments reveal that relative to results reported on lot streaming problems for five standard datasets, the proposed method saves substantial computation time and provides better solutions, especially for large-size problems. © 2019, Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Production scheduling is defined as the way of allocating resources or machines to process a set of tasks within a certain period. A flow shop production system requires scheduling to set up a job priority. This research takes place in a steel company located in Cilegon, Banten, which produces Bar Mill and Section Mill. There are two types of bar mill products, namely deformed bar mill and plain bar mill. These types of products are distinguished from their diameters. Among all products, the highest demand for bar mill Type is D.16, D.19, D.22, D.25 and D.32. However, during the period of time, the sequence of producing the Bar Mill is timely basis without considering the volume of the demand. This condition leads to longer completion time and makespan. Therefore, to solve the problem, we propose the application of production scheduling method by combining particle swarm optimization with Nawaz Enscore and Ham (NEH) algorithm as the initialization. The result shows that there is an improvement in makespan after applying the proposed method. Total makespan for existing condition is 721.87 h. The proposed method is capable to reduce the makespan into 695.76 h by applying particle swarm optimization method with random initialization. The scheduling using particle swarm optimization method with NEH initialization generates makespan of 678.04 h. Based on the results and analysis, the application of particle swarm optimization method with NEH initialization show a better performance compared to other scheduling methods. © 2019 Author(s).},

abstract={The employee allocation and production scheduling are the key factors in manufacturing enterprises. Especially, in small and medium enterprises, the working employees are the main resources of the production process. The employees gain orientation in variety skills; they can be assigned to any processes. Moreover, when the employees work for a long period, the productivity drops because of their working fatigue. Thus, the initial flow shop scheduling plan may not result as expected. This paper proposes to apply the re-optimization process for employee allocation during the production period. However, the re-optimization requires the setup time to start the new process. The proposed model introduces the rescheduling checking procedure to properly invoke the optimization process. The genetic algorithm is applied in the optimization process. The evaluation results show that the proposed model can reduce the makespan with the suitable rescheduling optimization process. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={To solve the problem of hybrid flow-shop sustainable scheduling, a multi-objective optimization model and modified genetic algorithm were proposed based on the performance of machine tools. The production time, energy consumption and cost in hybrid flow-shop were elaborated in the proposed mathematical model, and the performance of the machine tools in hybrid-shop were described with fuzzy membership method. In the modified GA algorithm, the adaptive crossover, mutation and elitist strategy were established according to the relationship between the membership degree of machine tools and weights of optimization objectives. Thus the selection pressure to the proper direction could be obtained so as to accelerate the convergence speed in the iteration of GA. A case study was used to verify the established model and algorithm by comparing the results obtained by different GA methods. Based on the optimization results, four kinds of typical workshop production scheduling modes including high efficiency, energy conservation, economy and comprehensive production were put forward to provide guidance for the sustainable production of hybrid flow-shop scheduling. © 2019, Editorial Department of CIMS.

abstract={Production scheduling is important for the electronic component manufacturing industry made from silicone rubber. Product completion time is one of the problems faced by the company. It often happens that products completion incapable of meeting due dates. This is caused by the inability of the molding workstation to complete the production process in the expected time. The production process requires 6 workstations with a hybrid flow-shop process, and one of them is a molding workstation. The problem encountered was to schedule 37 types of products with different order quantities and due dates. The lot size for each batch is different for each type of product, therefore each type of product with different order quantity will have different number of batches. The aim of the research is to minimize the total tardiness in batch completion time, using the metaheuristic approach Simulated Annealing (SA) with Python programming. The case study in this paper is to arrange the schedule of 37 types of products consisting of 574 batches at a molding workstation with 45 parallel machines that are independent. The results of data processing showed that total tardiness in molding machines was 13700 minutes. © 2020 SERSC.},

abstract={The energy-aware scheduling problem is a multi-objective optimization problem where the main goal is to achieve energy savings without affecting productivity in a manufacturing system. In this work, we present an approach for energy-aware flow shop scheduling problem and energy-aware job shop scheduling problem considering the process speed as the main energy-related decision variable. This approach allows one to set the appropriate process speed for every considered operation in the corresponding machine. When the speed is high, the processing time is short but the energy demand increases, and vice versa. Therefore, two objectives are worked together: a production objective, paired with an energy efficiency objective. A generic elitist multi-objective genetic algorithm was implemented to solve both problems. Results from a simple comparative design of experiments and a nonparametric test show that it is possible to smooth the energy demand profile and obtain reductions that average 19.8% in energy consumption. This helps to reduce peak loads and drops on applied energy sources demand, stabilizing the conversion units operational efficiency across the entire operational time with a minimum effect on the production maximum completion time (makespan). © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Genetic programming-based automatic heuristic generation is a hyper heuristic that can produce the key functions in a meta-heuristic for a problem. This paper studies the automatic heuristic generation method to automated generate dispatching rules for the hybrid flow shop scheduling problem, a classic scheduling problem with strong industrial background. First, a meta-heuristic based on list scheduling is given. Then a genetic programming is proposed to generate a dispatching rule which is to produce a job list in the metaheuristic. Experimental results indicate that the generated dispatching rules are superior to the classic rules. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Nowadays, energy demand has grown rapidly and remarkably in the different sector. More particularly the industry currently consumes about half of the world's energy. Furthermore, there has been a growing concern over the environmental impact of traditional manufacturing, especially in terms of energy consumption and related emissions of carbon dioxide. Besides the adoption of new equipment, production scheduling could play a key role in reducing the total energy consumption of a manufacturing plant. This article deals with the non-permutation flow shop scheduling problems with non-availability intervals to minimize the total energy consumption (TEC) and makespan (Cmax). Specifically, two kinds of unavailability constraints are investigated and the jobs are non-resumable in both cases. In the first case, the non- availability intervals are periodically fixed and known in advance. In the second case, the intervals are flexible and the machines' continuous working time cannot exceed a maximum allowed time. The mixed binary integer programming model is provided for deriving the optimal schedules. The problems of minimising makespan in such flow shops are proved Non-deterministic Polynomial-time hard in strong sense. To the best of our knowledge, no papers considering both production scheduling and unavailability constraints with minimizing the total of energy consumption and makespan in flow shop. The gap between theory and practice prevents the satisfying performance of the schedules in industry. The purpose of this paper is to establish a joint model for integrating the production and unavailability constraints to optimize the bi-objective of the total energy consumption and makespan simultaneously; and to make the theory applied in practice more efficaciously. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Production and preventive maintenance are very important functions in industry which act on the same resources. However, in most real workshops, the scheduling of their respective activities is independent and the constraint that they cannot be accomplished at the same time is rarely considered. Therefore, we are facing a joint scheduling problem of production and preventive maintenance tasks. In addition, this joint scheduling risks at any moment to deviate from the theoretical desired performances when facing disturbances due to various causes. Thus, we must still seek the most robust scheduling, i.e. the one that resists to uncertainties. This paper proposes a new approach to study robustness of joint production and maintenance scheduling in permutation flow shop workshops. The studied scheduling are generated according to two strategies: sequential and integrated. As methods of scheduling resolution, we will consider the well-known ants colony optimization, genetic algorithm, tabu search and some hybridizations of these methods. Our approach can be applied to other joint scheduling generating methods. In particular, we study how insertion of maintenance tasks can contribute to the robustness of production scheduling and how some scheduling strategies and methods are more robust than others. Several experimental results show the merits of our approach. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Limited waiting time constraint restricts the maximal and minimal waiting times of a job between consecutive machines. This constraint widely exist in the manufacturing environment with transportation requirement and high production continuity due to the unstable physical or chemical nature of intermediate product. The permutation flowshop scheduling problem with rejection is a joint decision of job rejection and production scheduling, which is to determine rejected jobs and the schedule with accepted jobs. This joint decision problem is considered with the objective to minimize the sum of total rejection cost and total tardiness cost, and an upper bound is set for the makespan in this problem. A co-evolutionary genetic algorithm is presented, in which an encoding scheme is proposed to divide a chromosome into two subsets, respectively corresponding to job rejection and job sequencing. The initial population is produced by dispatching rules, and the co-evolutionary strategy is introduced into this algorithm to coevolve the two subset population. Moreover, a memory-based dynamic probability generation method is presented to determine the probabilities to run the genetic operators, and some decoding rules are set to ensure the feasibility of a solution and optimize its total cost. Computational experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of this algorithm, and the impact of problem parameters on the performance of this algorithm are also studied in the experiments. © 2019, Editorial Office of Control and Decision.

abstract={Flow shop scheduling problems with queue time constraints abound in many types of industries. The waiting times between consecutive steps in flow shop production with queue time constraints cannot exceed a given interval. Typically, managers use mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to schedule the process starting times of jobs in a queue. However, as the number of jobs in the system increases, the MILP-based model cannot return an optimal solution within a reasonable time because of its combinatorial nature. This paper proposes a mixed integer programming with Lagrangian relaxation (MIPLAR) method to solve the time-indexed MILP model with a separable structure for the production scheduling problem with queue time constraints. Lagrangian relaxation techniques are used to decompose the problem into job-level subproblems, which are solved by dynamic programming. The subgradient method is used to solve the Lagrangian dual problem. A 4.6-month simulation study demonstrates that the proposed MIPLAR method improves the scrap count by a percentage range from 32.1% to 83.7% across the studied 16 scenarios compared to the first-in-first-out (FIFO) rule while maintaining the same range of the throughput. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this article, the issue of production scheduling in a no-idle flowshop environment is addressed. An extensive literature review has shown that there are no heuristics specifically proposed for this problem, especially when it comes to constructive heuristic methods. In this context, this article proposes a highly efficient simple constructive heuristic to minimize the total flowtime criterion. The proposed heuristic was embedded in the high performance iterated greedy algorithm. Computational results and statistical analysis show that the proposed heuristic overperformed the main constructive methods found up to now. In addition, it is observed that the integration of the proposed heuristic with the iterated greedy algorithm provides the most efficient metaheuristic for the problem. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This paper presents a survey on the applications of optimal control to scheduling in production, supply chain and Industry 4.0 systems with a focus on the deterministic maximum principle. The first objective is to derive major contributions, application areas, limitations, as well as research and application recommendations for the future research. The second objective is to explain control engineering models in terms of industrial engineering and production management. To achieve these objectives, optimal control models, qualitative methods of performance analysis and computational methods for optimal control are considered. We provide a brief historic overview and clarify major mathematical fundamentals whereby the control engineering terms are brought into correspondence with industrial engineering and management. The survey allows the grouping of models with only terminal constraints with application to master production scheduling, models with hybrid terminal–logical constraints with applications to short term job and flow shop scheduling, and hybrid structural–terminal–logical constraints with applications to customised assembly systems such as Industry 4.0. Computational algorithms in state, control and adjoint variable spaces are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In the energy-intensive sector, energy consumption has gained great attention, because of the increasing of energy costs and environmental implications. The optimization of production scheduling in these firms becomes a strategic key in the energy costs reduction. This study focuses on the scheduling optimization of an inflexible system consisting of a two-machine flow-shop without any buffer in between. An algorithm for addressing the no-wait/blocking constrained problem is introduced with the aim of minimizing the total energy cost of the system.

abstract={An Improved Fish Swarm Algorithm (IFSA) is proposed upon the assembly line optimization problem to implement optimal resource scheduling for production line. Taking a conveyor assembly line as a study case, this paper establishes the Parallel Conveyor Flow Shop using the JIT with Non-ideal condition (PCFJ-NC) based on the principle of lean production, after analyzing the influence of machined workpiece itself and other workpieces of conveyor; workpieces are identified by the RFID technology, which is commonly used in the industry informatization. In addition, given that there are some gaps of traditional algorithms if used for solving the conveyor assembly line scheduling problem, the IFSA based on polar coordinates is proposed to solve the conveyor assembly line production model. In the simulation test, for example, simulate a fault occurred on the parallel conveyor for bicycles produced by a plant, the assembly line schedule can be simulated against it. The results reveal that the rescheduling process as simulated by the proposed algorithm can reduce the production cost by 23.71% compared with the original scheduling schemes. The study provides the clues to guiding the assembly line workshop to improve the production efficiency and raising the standard for scientific schedule, as well as saving the workshop production cost. © 2019 Editura Politechnica.

abstract={PT. Avesta Continental Pack is a manufacturer of flexible packaging for pharmaceutical products. The company faces ineffective production scheduling and repeatedly failed to finish orders at the expected time limit. Customers requesting orders in different finishing time contributes in causing delays in the delivery process. Consequently, customers ended up claiming the fee because of the late delivery. Therefore, a more advanced scheduling system will assist the company in managing the delivery time. The purpose of this research is to establish the most effective job scheduling arrangement to minimize mean tardiness as well as mean lateness job. As the production process uses flow shop method, this research applies heuristic methods, such as Earliest Due Date (EDD) method, Short Processing Time (SPT), Nawaz, Enscore, and Ham (NEH) algorithm and Campbell, Dudek, and Smith (CDS) algorithm. The result shows that SPT method provides the most optimum outcome, specifically by reducing mean tardiness by 801.81 minutes or 85.57% and decreasing mean lateness job by 2 or 66.67%. The best job sequence is subsequently job 8 - job 4 - job 1 - job 6 - job 7 - job 5 - job 2 - job 3, which minimizes the average delay time from 937.05 minutes to 135.24 minutes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={PT. Plasindo Elok is a manufacturer that has been producing plastic protector and packaging system specifically for oil and gas company. All kinds of product which is produced by PT.Plasindo Elok, have the same sequences and at several production stages, there are a number of parallel machine with its different capacity (hybrid flow shop). The existing production scheduling was based on First Come First Serve (FCFS). The objective of this paper is to design a scheduling system to minimize makespan which could reduce WIP and total production cost. Flow shop heuristic method which is used as a basis to get the optimal makespan are NEH and CDS algorithm. Furthermore, the scheduling sequence of NEH and CDS are used to generate an initial sequence for metaheuristic method, Tabu Search (TS). The result of data processing showed that CDS algorithm represented the minimum makespan compared to NEH algorithm. The proposed methods CDS-TS and NEH-TS, produced the same minimum makespan, 14861,61 minutes with different mean flow time. Both hybrid algorithm (NEH-TS and CDS-TS) could reduce total makespan to 1697,93 minutes or 28,30 hours. The proposed method given to the company was NEH-TS with the production sequence of P10 - P12 - P13 - P8 - P7 - P4 - P5 - P2 - P1 - P11 - P9 -P3 - P14 - P6, NEH-TS was the best algorithm compared to NEH, CDS, and CDS-TS because it produced theleast makespan and mean flow time. In addition to facilitate company scheduling calculation, researcher designsa Java based scheduling program. © IEOM Society International.},

abstract={This paper studies a coordinated production and distribution scheduling problem in flowshop with limited waiting times, which restricts the maximal waiting times in consecutive processing machines and between the production and distribution. This problem usually arises in the manufacturing of timeliness products, such as food and newspaper. In this problem, one order contains many jobs. Job is the smallest unit in the production, and order is the smallest unit of transportation. Moreover, there is one vehicle for transportation, and only one order can be shipped at one time. This problem is a joint decision of production scheduling and distribution scheduling, which is a strongly NP-hard problem. A mixed integer programming model is established for this problem with the objective of minimizing the tardiness, and a co-evolutionary genetic algorithm is presented. Computational experiments were carried out and experimental results verified the effectiveness of the model and algorithm. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={The competition manufacturing companies face has driven the development of novel and efficient methods that enhance the decision making process. In this work, a specific flow shop scheduling problem of practical interest in the industry is presented and formalized using a mathematical programming model. The problem considers a manufacturing system arranged as a work cell that takes into account the transport operations of raw material and final products between the manufacturing cell and warehouses. For solving this problem, we present a multiobjective metaheuristic strategy based on simulated annealing, the Pareto Archived Simulated Annealing (PASA). We tested this strategy on two kinds of benchmark problem sets proposed by the authors. The first group is composed by small-sized problems. On these tests, PASA was able to obtain optimal or near-optimal solutions in significantly short computing times. In order to complete the analysis, we compared these results to the exact Pareto front of the instances obtained with augmented ε-constraint method. Then, we also tested the algorithm in a set of larger problems to evaluate its performance in more extensive search spaces. We performed this assessment through an analysis of the hypervolume metric.

abstract={Production and operations management is becoming increasingly challenging in a manufacturing system nowadays, as many processes are involved in the system and production performance is evaluated from different perspectives. Therefore, trade-off balancing is critical to achieve sustainable operations management. We propose a trade-off balancing model, and use our state space (SS) heuristic to show the effectiveness and efficiency in balancing trade-offs between utilization (Util) and work-in-process (WIP) inventories in a flow line. Our SS heuristic is superior to the best-known methods to max(Util) and min(WIP) respectively, showing consistent performance on trade-off balancing for adaptive production scheduling and control with variation in processing times. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In the last decades, the permutation flowshop scheduling problem (PFSP) has been thoroughly studied in combinatorial optimization and scheduling research. The most common objectives for this problem are makespan, total flowtime, and total tardiness. Furthermore, most production scheduling problems naturally involve multiples conflicting objectives to be optimized. Over the years, several approaches have been proposed to solve multi-objective PFSP. In the multi-objective optimization field of research, the multi-objective evolutionary algorithms based on decomposition has been recognized as one of the main strategies for solving multi-objective optimization problems. In this paper, we present a MOEA that integrates the decomposition approach and a probability model for ranking data (particularly, the Mallows model) for solving PFSP minimizing two and three objectives. We have conducted an extensive experimental study using a well-known benchmark set. In the bi-objective case, the proposed algorithm achieves competitive results compared to the best-known approximated Pareto fronts from the literature. In the tri-objective scenario, our algorithm achieves the best results in comparison to some state-of-the-art decomposition-based algorithms. © 2018},

abstract={In the past decades, a significant amount of attention has been attracted by operational production-distribution scheduling models. These models suggest that compared with hierarchical planning processes, the optimal plan can be achieved by considering the production and distribution decisions at the same time. For example, managers can schedule the production the delivery tasks consecutively. In a typical two-stage semi-continuous flow shop production plant, raw materials are converted into continuous resources in the first stage, and then, in the second stage, they are fed to the discrete-production processes of end products. Machines are employed to guarantee the continuous running of certain types of processes in each stage. Furthermore, the processing sequence at the first stage determines the readiness time and costs of resources. The product family is the basic scheduling element, and products sharing common materials and manufacturing procedures are categorised in the same product family. Taking these dependencies derived in practical manufacturing processes into consideration, various industrial cases can be fit in this model, including the food and drink industries or the metallurgical industry. This paper finally presented numerical-based tests on specific cases from an industrial application. © 2018, DAAAM International Vienna. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A production scheduling problem originating from a real rotor workshop is addressed in the paper. Given its specific characteristics, the problem is formulated as a re-entrant hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with machine eligibility constraints. A mixed integer linear programming model of the problem is provided and solved by the Cplex solver. In order to solve larger sized problems, a discrete differential evolution (DDE) algorithm with a modified crossover operator is proposed. More importantly, a new decoder addressing the machine eligibility constraints is developed and embedded to the algorithm. To validate the performance of the proposed DDE algorithm, various test problems are examined. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is compared with two other algorithms modified from the existing ones in the literatures. A one-way ANOVA analysis and a sensitivity analysis are applied to intensify the superiority of the new decoder. Tightness of due dates and different levels of scarcity of machines subject to machine eligibility restrictions are discussed in the sensitivity analysis. The results indicate the pre-eminence of the new decoder and the proposed DDE algorithm. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

And preventive maintenance and emergency repair cause the unavailability of machine will affect production efficiency. In order to solve the conflict between dispatch schedule and preventive maintenance plan. This paper develop a joint optimization on a hybrid flow shop model including not only batch processor but also discrete processor. And a preventive maintenance strategy based on reliability is designed. The multi-objective is to simultaneously minimize the makespan and total production cost. Particle swarm optimization and heuristic algorithm are proposed to solve the problem. Then a large number of computational instances are conducted. The experimental results show that joint optimization are superior compared with independent decision-making.

abstract={Most of the prior investigations related to production scheduling problems have solely focused on the optimization of an individual criterion under a single constraint; nevertheless, this is most of the time out of true in a real situation. This paper deals with multi machines permutation flow shop scheduling with limited buffers capacity and different release dates of jobs, where the performance is measured by the minimization of the weighted sum of maximum tardiness and makespan. To tackle this NP-hard problem, we present a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP). Thereafter, using CPLEX software, we generate a set of tests in an endeavor to examine formulation for dissimilar size problems in terms of optimality solution and computational CPU time complexity. Experiment results show that overall the proposed model is computationally avaricious to solve the considering problem. © 2018 PEI, University of Maribor. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Production scheduling has a considerable impact on productivity and resource assignment. In many situations, every job has an owner, which is called an agent. Since the agents are independent and selfish, it is possible that they have not any incentive to cooperate. Scheduling games help us to understand interactions between the agents. In this study, we consider a real firm with a flow shop manufacturing system that receives various orders from different agents so that each order belongs to a unique agent and includes some jobs. We propose a Nash bargaining model to find a compromise solution among agents. We suppose the utilities of the agents in disagreement point are non-deterministic. Therefore, to overcome this problem, we used linear programming with interval coefficients in order to find the best and the worst Nash bargaining solution. To find a compromised solution, we propose an improved genetic algorithm and compare it with other meta-heuristic algorithms. The comparisons indicate that the proposed algorithm has a good potential to evaluation of Nash bargaining problem in hybrid flow shop environment. Based on the results to reach an agreement between agents, it is required to create a trade-off between usage rates of fastest machines at each stage especially in bottleneck stages and total processing time of orders. The results indicate that the Nash bargaining solution is suitable to solve real-life agent-based production scheduling with the consideration of interactions among the agents when disagreement points are under uncertainty. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Over the last decade, manufacturing companies have identified renewable energy as a promising means to cope with time-varying energy prices and to reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. As a result of this development, global installed capacity of wind power has expanded significantly. To make efficient use of onsite wind power generation facilities in manufacturing, production scheduling tools need to consider the uncertainty attached to wind power generation along with changes in the energy procurement cost and in the products’ environmental footprints. To this end, we propose a solution procedure that first generates a large number of wind power scenarios that characterise the variability in wind power over time. Subsequently, a two-stage stochastic optimisation procedure computes a production schedule and energy supply decisions for a flow shop system. In the first stage, a bi-objective mixed integer linear programme simultaneously minimises the total weighted flow time and the expected energy cost, based on the generated wind power scenarios. In the second stage, energy supply decisions are adjusted based on real-time wind power data. A numerical example is used to illustrate the ability of the developed decision support tool to handle the uncertainty attached to wind power generation and its effectiveness in realising energy-related objectives in manufacturing. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Permutation flow shop scheduling is a part of production scheduling problems. It allows “n” jobs to be processed on “m” machines. All the jobs are processed in all the machines, and the sequence of jobs being processed is the same in all the machines. It plays a vital role in both automated manufacturing industries and nondeterministic polynomial hard problem. Gravitational emulation local search algorithm is a randomization-based concept algorithm. It is used iteratively as the local search procedure for exploring the local optimum solution. Modified gravitational emulation local search algorithm is used for both exploring and exploiting the optimum solution for permutation flow shop scheduling problems. In this work, modified gravitational emulation local search algorithm is proposed to solve the permutation flow shop scheduling problems with the objectives such as minimization of makespan and total flow time. The computational results show that the performance solution of the proposed algorithm gives better results than the previous author’s approaches. Statistical tools are also used for finding out a relationship that exists between the two variables (makespan and total flow time) and to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach against the previous approaches in the literature. © 2016, © IMechE 2016.},

abstract={We investigate a new variant of the hybrid flow shop problem (HFSP) considering machine blocking and both sequence-independent and sequence-dependent setup times. Since the HFSP is NP-hard, we propose heuristic algorithms along with priority rules based on the traditional SPT and LPT rules. We carried out computational experiments on simulated problem instances to test the performance of the priority rules. The objective function adopted was makespan minimization, and we used the rate of success and the relative deviation as performance criteria. The results indicate superiority of LPT-based rules. On instances with sequence-independent setup times, the LP rule, which is based on the non-increasing sorting of total processing times, outperformed other rules in most tested instances. In instances with sequence-dependent setup times, the LPS rule, which is based on the non-increasing sum of processing time and average setup times, outperformed other rules in most tested instances. © 2018, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.},

abstract={The typical production system in carton box production companies is cell-production. These cells normally benefit from a mobile robot which serves the machines according to a given schedule. One of the main problems of such companies is finding the order of robot moves in a way that the time required for completing all jobs is minimized. In the studied case in this research, each cell contains three machines of which, two or three of them might be activated for production process depending on the product type. These machines are equipped with a one-capacitated input and output buffer. Considering the fact that the machines are capable of performing any operation, the assignments of the jobs to them may have several alternatives. The one-capacitated buffers make the robot scheduling more complex as they act as extra stations to be served by the robot (contribute to exponential increase in job assignments permutation). This study aims to deal with this complexity and provide a decision-making toolbox for business owners to determine and employ the best robot moving schedule according to the characteristics of the problem. The mentioned approach significantly contributes to decision-maker’s effective time management and results in adopting a better production scheme for each production cycle. In line with this prospect, this research proposes a sequential part production matrix (SPPM) to determine feasible robot move strategies through which the best scheduling scheme is introduced for different problem configurations. Additionally, a metaheuristic algorithm is proposed to determine the best robot move strategy for cases with more active machines in a cell as manual determination of the robot move strategies becomes exhaustive in such cases. © 2017, German Academic Society for Production Engineering (WGP).},

abstract={Efficient and rational production flow shop scheduling (FSS) is the key to improving production efficiency, coping with market changes and promoting the core competitiveness of enterprises. In dealing with the flexible FSS problem, it has been more difficult for the traditional intelligent algorithm to find the optimal solution from the global perspective with the increase of the complexity of the system scale. Therefore, in this paper, by taking the flexible production FSS problem as the research object, the Agent-based decentralized production scheduling model guided by complex adaptive systems (CAS) was established. Besides, the model was locally optimized on the basis of Q-Learn algorithm and process value evaluation algorithm. The simulation experiment proves the feasibility of the scheduling optimization model based on Q-learn algorithm and process value evaluation algorithm in solving the flexible production FSS problem. This provides a practical solution for the actual production FSS problem. © 2018 Editura Politechnica. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Scheduling is one of the core links of modern industrial production. Scheduling needs to be designed according to the characteristics of the production line. In order to optimise the problem of workshop scheduling, the service-oriented programming idea and advanced technology to optimise the system development of mixed flow shop are adopted. The system is designed for applications in a distributed network environment. In this paper, an improved heuristic industrial production scheduling method is proposed to solve the scheduling system problem with multiple scheduling tasks, multiple processes, multiple stations, multiple constraints and rules. This method specifies the processing equipment, start time and completion time for each process of the production task. The application method shows that the proposed method can improve the automation and intelligence level of the scheduling process, improve the utilisation rate of equipment and other production resources, and give full play to the enterprise production capacity. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The production scheduling problem in hybrid flow shops is a complex combinatorial optimization problem observed in many real-world applications. The standard hybrid flow shop problem often involves unrealistic assumptions. In order to address the realistic assumptions, four additional traits were added to the proposed problem. These include the re-entrant line, setup times, position-dependent learning effects, and consideration of maximum completion time together with total tardiness as an objective function. Since the proposed problem is NP-hard, a meta-heuristic algorithm is proposed as the solution procedure. The solution procedure is categorized as an a priori approach. To show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, computational experiments were carried out on various test problems. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain an effective and appropriate solution quality for our investigated problem. © 2018 Sharif University of Technology.

abstract={Scheduling in foundry consist a type of production where, the hot work-in-processes cannot wait between two successive operations and can be modeled as a flow shop scheduling problem with no-wait constraint. With the objective to reduce total flow time, the appropriate sequence of jobs for scheduling is essential, hence the problem can be observed as typical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. This paper, proposes hybridization of Particle Swarm Optimization with simulated annealing for planning and scheduling issues which are very complex because of the ever changing needs of customers and existing constraints in foundry. This Proposed Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm represents solution by random key representation rule for converting the continuous position information values of particles to a discrete job permutation. The proposed hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm initializes population efficiently with Nawaz-Enscore-Ham heuristic and uses evolutionary search guided by the mechanism of PSO and local search by mechanism of simulated Annealing by balancing both global exploration and local exploitation. The proposed hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm try to bridge the gap between theory and practice by considering foundry environment, which will help planner to decide the sequence of production of jobs based against clients' orders and to develop efficient scheduling procedures for minimizing total flow time with relatively low computational efforts. Extensive computational experiments are carried out based on various casting's (job's) characteristics viz. casting type, mould size and type of alloy, where size of job (n) considered as 10,12,20,50 and 100. With respect to performance measure, Average Relative Percent Deviation which is popular in the scheduling literature, the proposed method performs better than Simulated Annealing and Particle Swarm Optimization. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={This paper deals with the integration of production scheduling and maintenance planning in order to optimize the bi-objective of quality robustness and solution robustness for flow shops with failure uncertainty. First, a proactive model is proposed to formulate the problem mathematically. Then, Monte Carlo sampling method is adopted to obtain the objective value for feasible solutions and a surrogate measure is proposed to approximate the objective function efficiently. Based on the sampling method and surrogate measure, a two-loop algorithm is devised to optimize the sequence of jobs, positions of preventive maintenances and idle times simultaneously. Computational results indicate that solution robustness and stability of quality robustness can be significantly improved using our algorithm compared with the solutions obtained by the traditional way. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This study deals with a hybrid flowshop system with sequence-dependent setup times. Two objectives have been considered. Minimizing makespan for production purpose along with minimizing unavailability of the system for maintenance purpose are the objectives of this problem. Two meta-heuristics have been developed for the research problem. First one is a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), while the second one is a hybridized NSGA-II (HNSGA-II), which is accompanied by a local search procedure to create better results. These two algorithms allow the decision maker to find compromise solutions between production objectives and preventive maintenance ones. Two decisions should be taken at the same time: finding the best assignment and sequence of jobs on machines in order to minimize the makespan, and deciding how often to perform preventive maintenance actions in order to minimize the system unavailability. Three approaches have been suggested for evaluation and comparison the efficiency of algorithms. The results indicate that the HNSGA-II presents better solutions compared to the ordinal NSGA-II in terms of objective functions viewpoint, while the results are obviously reversed in balance degree of achieving both objectives simultaneously. © 2017, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.},

abstract={The permutation flow shop scheduling problem (PFSSP), one of the most widely studied production scheduling problems, is a typical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper, a hybrid harmony search algorithm with efficient job sequence mapping scheme and variable neighborhood search (VNS), named HHS, is proposed to solve the PFFSP with the objective to minimize the makespan. First of all, to extend the HHS algorithm to solve the PFSSP effectively, an efficient smallest order value (SOV) rule based on random key is introduced to convert continuous harmony vector into a discrete job permutation after fully investigating the effect of different job sequence mapping schemes. Secondly, an effective initialization scheme, which is based on NEH heuristic mechanism combining with chaotic sequence, is employed with the aim of improving the solution's quality of the initial harmony memory (HM). Thirdly, an opposition-based learning technique in the selection process and the best harmony (best individual) in the pitch adjustment process are made full use of to accelerate convergence performances and improve solution accuracy. Meanwhile, the parameter sensitivity is studied to investigate the properties of HHS, and the recommended values of parameters adopted in HHS are presented. Finally, by making use of a novel variable neighborhood search, the efficient insert and swap structures are incorporated into the HHS to adequately emphasize local exploitation ability. Experimental simulations and comparisons on both continuous and combinatorial benchmark problems demonstrate that the HHS algorithm outperforms the standard HS algorithm and other recently proposed efficient algorithms in terms of solution quality and stability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Design, production and installation of track slabs are critical technologies of high-speed rail which has become an important trend of the transportation development across the world. This paper mainly investigates the scheduling arrangements and optimization of precast production of track slabs. A Flow-Shop Multi-Objective Optimization Scheduling Model (FSMSM) has been developed and solved by a Hybrid Genetic and Ant Colony Algorithm (HGACA). Comparisons among HGACA, single Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Algorithm and classical heuristic rules show that the HGACA could obtain better schedules for the model. By means of co-scheduling factory production and engineering construction, scientific and efficient precast production has been promoted and management ability of the industry has been enhanced. It may help manufacturers save enterprise resource, reduce labor consumption, decrease inventory costs, enhance production flexibility and improve enterprise's Level of Service. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to increasing concerns about energy and environmental demands, decision-makers in industrial companies have developed awareness about energy use and energy efficiency when engaging in short-term production scheduling and planning. This paper studied a flow-shop scheduling problem consisting of a series of processing stages and one final quality check stage with the aim of minimising energy consumption. In particular, the product quality in the problem depends on its processing time at each stage, and the energy consumption is related to the processing speed, equipment state and product quality. A novel three-stage decomposition approach is presented to solve the proposed energy-aware scheduling (EAS) problem. The decomposition approach can drastically reduce the search space and provide reliable solutions for the EAS problem. The numerical experiments show that the computational results can achieve an optimality gap of less than 4% when compared to the global optimal solutions. The parameter analysis demonstrates the managerial implications of the proposed problem. For example, increasing the number of alternative processing speeds or relaxing the delivery date will increase energy efficiency. The energy-saving potential is illustrated by comparing the scheduling results using the proposed approach and human experience. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The development of more efficient and better performing priority dispatching rules (PDRs) for production scheduling is relevant to modern flow shop scheduling practice because they are simple, easy to apply and have low computational complexity, especially for large-scale problems. While the current research trend in scheduling is towards finding superior solutions through meta-heuristics, they are computationally expensive and many meta-heuristics also use PDRs to generate starting points. In this paper, we analyse the properties of flow shop scheduling problems to minimise maximum completion time, and generate a new dominance rule that is complementary to Szwarc’s rule. These dominance rules indicate that a weighting factor should be included in sequencing to account for the possibility that a single job’s processing time can generate idle time repeatedly within a flow line. Two new PDRs with a leveraged weighting factor are proposed to minimise makespan and average completion time. Computational results on Taillard’s benchmark problems and on historical operating room data show that the proposed PDRs perform much better than established PDRs without an increase in computational complexity. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Scheduling is one of the most important decisions in production control. An approach is proposed for supporting users to solve scheduling problems, by choosing the combination of physical manufacturing system configuration and the material handling system settings. The approach considers two alternative manufacturing scheduling configurations in a two stage product oriented manufacturing system, exploring the hybrid flow shop (HFS) and the parallel flow shop (PFS) environments. For illustrating the application of the proposed approach an industrial case from the automotive components industry is studied. The main aim of this research to compare results of study of production scheduling in the hybrid and the parallel flow, taking into account the makespan minimization criterion. Thus the HFS and the PFS performance is compared and analyzed, mainly in terms of the makespan, as the transportation times vary. The study shows that the performance HFS is clearly better when the work stations' processing times are unbalanced, either in nature or as a consequence of the addition of transport times just to one of the work station processing time but loses advantage, becoming worse than the performance of the PFS configuration when the work stations' processing times are balanced, either in nature or as a consequence of the addition of transport times added on the work stations' processing times. This means that physical layout configurations along with the way transport time are including the work stations' processing times should be carefully taken into consideration due to its influence on the performance reached by both HFS and PFS configurations.},

abstract={In order to achieve excellence in manufacturing, goals like lean, economic and quality production with enhanced productivity play a crucial role in this competitive environment. It also necessitates major improvements in generally three technical areas: variation reduction, equipment reliability and production scheduling. The multi-criteria flow shop scheduling problem with sequence dependent setup times (SDST) is one of the most difficult classes. Efficient supervision of heuristics along with setup times is one of the significant features to enhance the performance of manufacturing system. In the present work, we formulate multi-criteria decision making for flow shop scheduling problem & also proposed five special heuristics based on hybrid genetic algorithm. Experiments are conducted on the benchmark problems as proposed by Taillard [15].Performance of proposed heuristics are tested, analyzed and compared with the help of a defined performance index, known as relative percentage deviation. From the results and analysis, it is concluded that the performance of SHGA5 and SHGA3 are found to be the best for 5 machines and 10 machines respectively. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={This study investigates the simultaneous scheduling of production and planning of maintenance activities in the flow shop scheduling environment. The problem is considered in a bi-objective form, minimizing the makespan as the production scheduling criterion and minimizing the system unavailability as the maintenance planning criterion. We propose the coordinative production and maintenance scheduling model in which the time interval between consecutive maintenance activities as well as the number of maintenance activities on each machine are assumed to be non-fixed. The coordinative model aims to find the best permutation of jobs as the production problem and to assign the maintenance activities into the schedule as the maintenance problem, simultaneously. Moreover, a special setting called single server maintenance is introduced and discussed. A bi-objective ant colony system algorithm is presented to solve the problem in focus, introducing some novel ideas. CDS and NEH heuristics are applied to define the heuristic information part of the proposed algorithm. Some experiments are carried out to select the appropriate heuristic method between CDS and NEH. Moreover, some experiments are performed using the well-known Taillard benchmark, comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm with another ant colony optimization algorithm. Computational experiments indicate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The permutation flowshop problem is a classic machine scheduling problem where n jobs must be processed on a set of m machines disposed in series and where each job must visit all machines in the same order. Many production scheduling problems resemble flowshops and hence it has generated much interest and had a big impact in the field, resulting in literally hundreds of heuristic and metaheuristic methods over the last 60 years. However, most methods proposed for makespan minimisation are not properly compared with existing procedures so currently it is not possible to know which are the most efficient methods for the problem regarding the quality of the solutions obtained and the computational effort required. In this paper, we identify and exhaustively compare the best existing heuristics and metaheuristics so the state-of-the-art regarding approximate procedures for this relevant problem is established. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The aim of this work is to bridge the gap between the theory and actual practice of production scheduling by studying a problem from a real-life production environment. This paper considers a practical Sanitaryware production system as a number of make-to-order permutation flowshop problems. Due to the wide range of variation in its products, real-time arrival of customer orders, dynamic batch adjustments, and time for machine setup, Sanitaryware production system is complex and also time sensitive. In practice, many such companies run with suboptimal solutions. To tackle this problem, in this paper, a memetic algorithm based real-time approach has been proposed. Numerical experiments based on real data are also been presented in this paper. © 2016 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={This paper gives insights on the usability of single priority and multi-criteria dispatching rules for production scheduling based on the results for a German chipboard manufacturing plant. A discrete-event simulation of the manufacturing process has been modeled to compare different priority rules with an expert-based sequence for a real set of jobs. The simulation results show that using one single or multi-criteria priority dispatching rule on the total production system basically leads to a poor performance, whereas using different rules for each machine will enhance the overall performance. Higher performance can be achieved by the expert-based scheduling and individual multi-criteria dispatching rules. Hence, a dynamic modification of the production schedule by switching the dispatching rules according to the current performance is proposed, considering unforeseen disturbances. © 2017 DEStech Publications.

abstract={This paper elaborates an integrated model of batch production scheduling and maintenance scheduling on flow shop with two machines producing single item to be delivered at a common due date. The objective function of the model is to minimize total cost consisting of in process and completed part inventory costs, setup costs, preventive and corrective maintenance costs and rework cost on two machines. The Model was a mixed integer quadratic that contains some integer and binary variables, so that analytic search solution could not be used for the model. It was developed a stepwise optimization method to solve the model. This model describes the trade-off between production cost and maintenance cost as the increasing of production run length on two machines. An example is given to clarify how the model solved. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In the process of workshop production scheduling, many risk factors can affect the reliability of production. The factors influencing the production scheduling include time, quality, equipment failure and so on. The stability is critical in the flow shop, so the risk factors related to the production scheduling should be considered in the workshop production. Workshop scheduling is taken as the research object in this paper. Along with the rapid development of database technology, the process of workshop production scheduling also involves the record and statistics of many historical production data. So data analysis technology will be used to analyze the risk factors in the process of workshop scheduling firstly inthis paper. Secondly, the simulation model for production scheduling integrated with the risk factors will be built. The aim of the model is to balance the flow shop plan and improve the production efficiency. Finally, an example is given to show that the risk factors selected in this paper and the model are effective for solving the risk problem of workshop production scheduling. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={This work addresses the minimization of the makespan criterion for the permutation flow shop problem with blocking, sequence and machine dependent setup times, which is a problem that has not been studied in previous works. Many papers considered the problem with an unlimited buffer or with the setup time embedded in the processing time of the job. However, considering an unlimited buffer may not represent reality in many industries. Additionally, separating the setup time from the processing time allows greater flexibility for production scheduling, thus allowing better time usage and a reduction in the makespan. Two structural properties of the problem are presented: an upper bound for the machine idle time and a lower bound for the machine blocking time. Using these properties, four lower bounds for the makespan are proposed (LBTN1, LBTN2, LBTN3 and LBTN4). Each of the lower bounds was used in a branch-and-bound algorithm and then compared to each other using a database containing 540 problems. A MILP model is also presented and compared with the best of the branch-and-bound models using a second database that consists of 80 different problems. Computational tests are presented, and the comparisons indicate that the proposed lower bounds are promising. © 2017 The Author(s).

abstract={Activities in mining complexes contain multiple decisions that affect the operations of the system for the extraction, transformation, transport and storage of various subsoil components. The purpose of this research is the planning of continuous flow production systems for mixed products, in non-metallic mining extraction processes, considering bottlenecks and capacity planning. This paper presents a model for production, based on mathematical optimization, that facilitates the planning and management of operations in the area of extraction, crushing and transformation of a quarry of aggregates for construction, considering the resources and the constraints that allow to define effective strategies in the increase of the productivity of the lines of low production environment by scenarios. This research develops an analysis of bottlenecks and contrasts the nature of the production system by means of a mathematical model of optimization, which considers the capacities and balances in the flows of the Limestone production line. The mathematical model that maximizes profits can be adapted to systems of continuous flow production in mining complexes where their products are part of a reverse logistics process, analysis of alternatives of extraction, transformation and transport. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Scheduling is a significant decision making process widely used in manufacturing production, management, computer science, etc. Operation research scheduling can reduce material handling costs and time by optimising the procedure. Finding good schedules for given sets of jobs so can help factory supervisors to control job flows effectively and provide solutions for job sequencing. Scheduling problems are usually modelled and solved in a mathematically feasible way. As a result the solutions generated from these greatly simplified problems are infeasible for real-life cases. The complexity and instability of production systems are still underestimated in many scheduling techniques in academic literature and the flexible production concept in mould shop has been rarely studied. It is necessary to develop an appropriate scheduling procedure algorithm to meet the industry's need. The study presents an approach to solve NP-Hard Flexible Flow Shop problems of more than two machine center to obtain optimum makespan. This approach uses First in First out (FIFO) dispatching rule and second approach integrates Random key method with Genetic Algorithm (RKGA) these approach has been implemented with MATLAB R2014a the approach has been tested on a Flexible Flow Shop Problem which was solved previously by the random keys representation can avoid the existence of duplicated positions value in sequencing. The result shows that Random Key Genetic Algorithm approach obtains the best minimum optimum makespan for different set of jobs with different processing time. Though the computation time is more comparatively to the FIFO approach. The RKGA can be applied in different scheduling problems in future study. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={Flow shop scheduling problem is a type of scheduling dealing with sequencing jobs on a set of machines in compliance with predetermined processing orders. Each production stage to be scheduled in typical flow shop scheduling contains only one machine. However, in automotive part industry, many parts are produced in sequential flow shop containing more than one machines in each production stage. This circumstance cannot apply the existing method of flow shop scheduling. The objective of this research is to schedule the production process of automotive parts. The feature production is hybrid flow shop which consists of two-stages. In each stage, there are several manufacturing machines and each machine can produce more than one product. Thus, production scheduling is a complex problem. This paper, therefore, develops mathematical model to solve the hybrid flow shop production scheduling under different constraints of each machine. The setup time and production time of each machine can be different for each part. The solution for the experimental data sets from an automotive part manufacturer reveals that the process time can be reduced by 34.29%. © ECMS Zita Zoltay Paprika, Péter Horák, Kata Váradi,Péter Tamás Zwierczyk, Ágnes Vidovics-Dancs, János Péter Rádics (Editors).},

abstract={As the economic growth of China gradually slows down in recent years, the flow-shop production enterprises pay more and more attention to the production capacity planning problem. The order selection problem plays a central role in the production capacity planning of flow-shop production enterprises. Traditional order selection models separate the processes of production scheduling and order selection. The performance of the order selection depends entirely on production scheduling. In this paper we study the relationship between the processes of order selection and production scheduling, and propose a new nonlinear 0–1 programming model aiming at profit maximization. Our new model considers simultaneously order selection and production scheduling and we will demonstrate that our new model generates a production schedule that is much better than that from traditional models. We solved the new model using Lingo 11.0 and numerical results show that the optimal solution can be obtained within an hour on a personal computer when the order size is less than 16. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={On-site renewable electricity generation represents an attractive option for manufacturing enterprises to deal with time varying electricity prices while reducing their carbon footprint. Production scheduling can be used to take full advantage of the installed renewable energy capacity for electricity cost reduction. A dynamic scheduling approach is proposed to minimize the electricity cost of a flow shop with a grid-integrated wind turbine. Time series models are used to provide updated wind speed and electricity prices as actual data becomes available. The production schedule and energy supply decisions are adjusted based on the new information. The approach is demonstrated using a case study. © 2017},

abstract={This paper considers the problem of the multi-objective scheduling with makespan and total flow time minimizations for blocking flow shop.A multi-objective discrete differential evolution (MDDE) is proposed for searching alternative Pareto solutions,in which mutant individual is obtained by Pareto front solution or incumbent solution,and trial individual is generated by crossover operation while selection process is designed as a multi-objective selection strategy.Moreover,an insertion-based Pareto local search procedure is hybridized in this algorithm.The computational experiments on a bunch of instances for blocking flow shop show that the proposed algorithm can attain better non-dominated solution set in term of three performance measures,i.e.,Inverted Generational Distance,Set Coverage,and Hypervolume. © 2016, East China University of Science and Technology.

abstract={Due to increasing energy requirements and associated environmental impacts, nowadays manufacturing companies are facing the emergent challenges to meet the demand of sustainable manufacturing. Most existing research on reducing energy consumption in production scheduling problems has focused on static scheduling models. However, there exist many unexpected disruptions like new job arrivals and machine breakdown in a real-world production scheduling. In this paper, it is proposed an approach to address the dynamic scheduling problem reducing energy consumption and makespan for a flexible flow shop scheduling. Since the problem is strongly NP-hard, a novel algorithm based on an improved particle swarm optimization is adopted to search for the Pareto optimal solution in dynamic flexible flow shop scheduling problems. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper presents a new bi-objective mixed integer programming model for the two-stage assembly flow shop scheduling problem with preventive maintenance (PM) activities, in which the reliability/availability approach is employed to model the maintenance concepts of a problem. PM activities carry out the operations on machines and tools before the breakdown takes place. Therefore, it helps to prevent failures before they happen. After developing a new bi-objective model, an Epsilon-constraint method is proposed to solve the problem. This problem has been known as Np-hard. Therefore, three multi-objective optimization methods, namely fast non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, Multi-objective imperialist competitive algorithm, and non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm (NRGA) are employed to find the pareto-optimal front for large sized problems. The parameters of the proposed algorithms are calibrated using artificial neural network (ANN) and the performances of the proposed algorithms on the problems of various sizes are analyzed and the computational results reveal that NRGA outperform than two other proposed algorithms in quality of solutions and computational time. © 2016 Chinese Institute of Industrial Engineers.},

abstract={One of the most important assumptions in production scheduling is permanent availability of the machines without any breakdown. In real-world scheduling problems, machines could be unavailable due to various reasons such as preventive maintenance and unpredicted breakdowns. In this paper, a flowshop scheduling problem under machine breakdown uncertainty is studied. The machines are subject to breakdown in practice caused by components’ wear-out. A proactive scheduling is considered to deal with unpredictable machine breakdown. An effective hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm based on genetic and simulated annealing algorithms is proposed to tackle such an NP-hard problem. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, its performance in terms of maximising the β-robustness of makespan was compared with six other heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms. Computational results confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms the others. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The permutation flow shop scheduling problem (PFSSP) is one of the most widely studied production scheduling problems and a typical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems as well. In this paper, a self-guided differential evolution with neighborhood search (NS-SGDE) is presented for the PFSSP with the objectives of minimizing the maximum completion time. Firstly, some constructive heuristics are incorporated into the discrete harmony search (DHS) algorithm to initialize the population. Secondly, a guided agent based on the probabilistic model is proposed to guide the DE-based exploration phase to generate the offspring. Thirdly, multiple mutation and crossover operations based on the guided agent are employed to explore more effective solutions. Fourthly, the neighborhood search based on the variable neighborhood search (VNS) is designed to further improve the search ability. Moreover, the convergence of NS-SGDE for PFSSP is analyzed according to the theory of Markov chain. Computational simulations and comparisons with some existing algorithms based on some widely used benchmark instances of the PFSSP are carried out, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NS-SGDE in solving the PFSSP. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Scheduling defines the priority of activities to meet the requirements by considering various constraints or objectives. In scheduling, time is a key constraint and it must be utilized in an optimum manner. Scheduling aims to reduce the manufacturing lead time and to improve on time delivery of products. In this paper, two popular algorithms such as genetic algorithm and greedy algorithm are proposed to solve the job shop and flow shop production scheduling problem respectively, with sequence dependant setup times. The objective is to minimize the make span and also reduces the maximum job completion times. The greedy method is a well known approach for permutation flow shop scheduling problem solving directed mainly at the solution of optimization problems. Cost function to be optimized and whole task can be executed faster by using greedy algorithm, so the greedy method is considered as a combination of cost model and benefit model. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={To solve the hybrid flow shop scheduling problems with makespan criterion, a genetic algorithm based on active scheduling technique and forward-backward scheduling approach was proposed. The active scheduling technique was used to reduce the search space, while the forward-backward scheduling approach was adopted to overcome the dependence on problem data, and to improve the population diversity. In the algorithm design, a new chromosome encoding was innovated to represent a complete solution of active schedule and its generating mechanism. With this coding scheme, a population initializing strategy and the genetic operations were designed based on active scheduling technique with effective dispatching rules. The experimental results of benchmark instances indicated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which could not only reach optimal solutions for all the type a and b instances in a very short time, but also find high-quality solutions for type c and d instances just with a small average percentage deviation of 3.060%. © 2016, Editorial Department of CIMS.

abstract={This paper stablishes the model of the integrated batch planning process, and proposes an improved algorithm for this problem. The simulation results of a computerized scheduling system are given to prove the fitness of the model. The steel making casting production process scheduling problem is very difficult to get a good performance solution in practice. The scheduling of steelmaking casting production is a complicated problem of combinational optimization in the hybrid flow shop, which is an NP-Hard problem, and determining the polynomial time algorithm to arrive at the accurate optimal solution has proved to be a difficult task. An improved fuzzy genetic optimization and improved algorithm strategy are proposed.

abstract={This paper investigates an integrated optimisation problem of production scheduling and preventive maintenance (PM) in a two-machine flow shop with time to failure of each machine subject to a Weibull probability distribution. The objective is to find the optimal job sequence and the optimal PM decisions before each job such that the expected makespan is minimised. To investigate the value of integrated scheduling solution, computational experiments on small-scale problems with different configurations are conducted with total enumeration method, and the results are compared with those of scheduling without maintenance but with machine degradation, and individual job scheduling combined with independent PM planning. Then, for large-scale problems, four genetic algorithm (GA) based heuristics are proposed. The numerical results with several large problem sizes and different configurations indicate the potential benefits of integrated scheduling solution and the results also show that proposed GA-based heuristics are efficient for the integrated problem. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={To solve the Hybrid Flow Shop with non-identical parallel machine Load Balancing Scheduling Problem (HFS-LBSP), a mathematical model was formulated. The weighted summation of processing time load balancing cost and total parallel machine waiting time was taken as the load balancing comprehensive evaluation index. A Double Population Self-adaptive Differential Evolution (DPSADE) algorithm was proposed for global optimization purpose. In DPSADE algorithm, a new bi-population construction methodology and cooperative evolution mechanism was devised for the usage of maintaining the population diversity and evolution energy, and a self-adaptive parameter adjusting strategy in terms of stop iterations was introduced to enhance the capacity in escaping from the local optimal and keeping evolution alive. To improve the searching efficiency of the algorithm, a new population initialization method based on load balancing selection probability was designed at the initialization stage. Two example of production scheduling problem for car manufacturing and steel smelting processing were simulated, and the results showed that the load balance evaluation index of DPSADE algorithm had a significant reduction compared with Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution algorithm(DE) and Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution algorithm (SADE). © 2016, CIMS.

abstract={This paper deals with the no-wait flow shop scheduling problem in order to minimize the total time to complete the schedule or makespan. It is introduced a constructive heuristic which builds the production schedule from job partial sequences by using an appropriate mechanism of insertion. An extensive computational experiment has been performed to evaluate the performance of proposed heuristic. Experimental results have clearly shown that the presented heuristic provides better solutions than those from the best heuristics existing. © 2016 KIIE.},

abstract={The Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (FSSP) is a problem that is commonly found by master production scheduling planners in Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS). The planner should find the optimal scheduling to carry out a set of jobs. All the jobs are processed in a production line composed of a set of shared machines. Furthermore, the jobs are processed in the same sequence. In order to be able to analyze this problem in a better way, this problem needs to be represented adequately for understanding the relationship among the operations that are carried out. Thus, an FMS presenting the FSSP can be modeled by Petri nets (PNs), which are a powerful tool that has been used to model and analyze discrete event systems. Then, the makespan can be obtained by simulating the PN through the token game animation. In this work, we propose an timed place PN to calculate the makespan of FSSP.},

abstract={An integrated manufacturing/remanufacturing system is considered in this paper with the aim of scheduling the operations of the manufacturing plant. The system is partially closed in the sense that the raw materials, necessary for assembling the final products, can be obtained both from an internal remanufacturing plant (which disassembles returned products) and from external suppliers. The manufacturing system is modelled as a flexible flow shop whose stages represent the different assembly phases leading to the final products. In this paper, an original event-based mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation is presented, whose objective consists of minimizing, as primary objective, the weighted number of tardy jobs and, as secondary ones, the fixed and variable purchase costs of raw materials possibly acquired from external suppliers. Due to the complexity of the problem, the MIP formulation can be used to solve only small instances. For this reason, a matheuristics is proposed, which consists of three interoperating mathematical programming models: the first model assigns the jobs to the machines; the second model sequences the jobs on the machines; the third model defines the external supplies, taking into account the component availability constraints. A preliminary computational analysis shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The machine utilisation remains one of the most important objectives of the production planning and scheduling. Although utilisation is a characteristics of a long term stochastic process and the makespan describes only a single deterministic schedule, in production scheduling models maximization of utilisation is usually approximated by makespan minimization. Presented analysis of typical production planning system and experimental results show that in permutation flow shop systems with unlimited buffers the impact of makespan minimization on long-term machine utilisation might be significantly overestimated. To bridge this gap between theory and practice a new measure of quality considering multiple schedules is proposed. © Copyright AGH-UST, Kraków, Polska, 2016.},

abstract={In this paper, an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA)-based memetic algorithm (MA) is proposed for solving the distributed assembly permutation flow-shop scheduling problem (DAPFSP) with the objective to minimize the maximum completion time. A novel bi-vector-based method is proposed to represent a solution for the DAPFSP. In the searching phase of the EDA-based MA (EDAMA), the EDA-based exploration and the local-search-based exploitation are incorporated within the MA framework. For the EDA-based exploration phase, a probability model is built to describe the probability distribution of superior solutions. Besides, a novel selective-enhancing sampling mechanism is proposed for generating new solutions by sampling the probability model. For the local-search-based exploitation phase, the critical path of the DAPFSP is analyzed to avoid invalid searching operators. Based on the analysis, a critical-path-based local search strategy is proposed to further improve the potential solutions obtained in the EDA-based searching phase. Moreover, the effect of parameter setting is investigated based on the Taguchi method of design-of-experiment. Suitable parameter values are suggested for instances with different scales. Finally, numerical simulations based on 1710 benchmark instances are carried out. The experimental results and comparisons with existing algorithms show the effectiveness of the EDAMA in solving the DAPFSP. In addition, the best-known solutions of 181 instances are updated by the EDAMA. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, power shortages have become a major problem all over Japan, due to the Great East Japan Earthquake, which resulted in the shutdown of a nuclear power plant. As a consequence, production scheduling has become a problem for factories, due to considerations of the availability of electric power. For factories, the contract with the electric power company sets the maximum power demand for a unit period, and in order to minimize this, it is necessary to consider the peak power when scheduling production. There are conventional studies on flowshop scheduling with consideration of peak power. However, these studies did not consider fluctuations in the processing time. Because the actual processing time is not constant, there is an increase in the probability of simultaneous operations with multiple machines. If the probability of simultaneous operations is high, the probability of increasing the peak power is high. Thus, we consider inserting idle time (delay in inputting parts) into the schedule in order to reduce the likelihood of simultaneous operations. We consider a robust schedule that limits the peak power, in spite of an unexpected fluctuation in the processing time. However, when we insert idle time, the makespan gets longer, and the production efficiency decreases. Therefore, we performed simulations to investigate the optimal amount of idle time and the best point for inserting it. We propose a more robust production scheduling model that considers random processing times and the peak power consumption. The results of experiments show that the effectiveness of the schedule produced by the proposed method is superior to the initial schedule and to a schedule produced by another method. Thus, the use of random processing times can limit the peak power. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We address a novel integrated maintenance and production scheduling problem in a multi-machine and multi-period production system, considering maintenance as a long-term decision. Deterioration of machines over time decreases production capacity. Since maintenance activities not only improve machine conditions, increasing production capacity, but also take time that cannot be used for production, the challenge is to assign maintenance to periods and to schedule maintenance and production activities within each period to minimize the combined cost of maintenance and lost production over the planning horizon. Motivated by logic-based Benders decomposition, we design an integrated two-stage algorithm to solve the problem. The first stage assigns maintenance to machines and time periods, abstracting the scheduling problem, while the second stage creates a schedule for the current time period. The first stage is then re-solved using feedback from the schedule. This iteration between maintenance planning and scheduling continues until the solution costs in two stages converge. The integrated approach models the interdependencies between maintenance and scheduling decisions in highly coupled processes such as wafer fabrication in the semiconductor manufacturing. Our results demonstrate that the benefit of integrated decision making increases when maintenance is less expensive relative to lost production cost and that a longer horizon for maintenance planning is beneficial when maintenance cost increases. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Fitness function is structured through that the delivery period by the earliness / tardiness penalties to join the hybrid flow shop scheduling optimization process. Delivery of hybrid flow shop earliness and tardiness scheduling model is structured to realize the global assigned of production task. Some of production of work piece machining path will be determined. Comparative analysis of the results of numerical calculation through multi - group program proves that self-adaptive DE algorithm achieves better results in solving hybrid flow shop delivery of hybrid flow shop scheduling problem. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper studies a synchronised scheduling problem of production simultaneity and shipment punctuality in a two-stage assembly flowshop system. Production simultaneity seeks to ensure all products belonging to a same customer order are simultaneously completed (at least as close as possible). Shipment punctuality attempts to satisfy orders individual shipment due dates. We provide two criteria, i.e. mean longest waiting duration and mean earliness and tardiness, for measuring production simultaneity and shipment punctuality, respectively. A synchronised scheduling model is developed by balancing the two criteria using linear weighted sum method. A modified genetic algorithm (GA) is then proposed for solving this model. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results indicate that considering production simultaneity can remarkably reduce finished products inventory. A prioritised weight combination interval for production simultaneity and shipment punctuality has been suggested. Production simultaneity is affected by the production system configuration, especially in peak seasons. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={In today’s competitive world, each company which is involved in production activities should try to adjust its production scheduling with customers’ order. This reality was one of the principals of emerging just-in-time philosophy which tries to fulfill each customer’s order in exact size of his demand and at the earliest time which is preferred by him. This is the main reason why those industries which produce high variety of goods have been trying to change their production policy from batch production of a single type to batch production mixed of different types which is called minimal part set. With this motivation, cyclic policy which also attempts to reduce work-in-process inventory arouse in production systems. Although hybrid flow shop is one of the most important and notable problems in sequencing and scheduling, there has not yet been any research that considers use of cyclic policy in hybrid flow shop. This problem is which this paper tries to peruse. Moreover, we try to reduce the gap between theoretical and practical problems by considering unrelated parallel machines, eligibility, and limited buffer constraints. In this paper, a mixed integer linear programming model is proposed at first. Because of the NP-hard nature of the problem, some heuristics and meta-heuristics are proposed for solving the problem and are compared then. At last, all the results show that a simulated annealing method using some embedded heuristics in it is an effective approach for solving this problem. © 2014, Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={Utilization and work-in-process (WIP) inventories of flow lines are two managerial concerns in manufacturing systems. They relate to two objectives in flowshop production scheduling respectively. Minimization of maximum completion time relates to utilization improvement of flow lines, and minimization of average completion time relates to WIP inventory management. However, these two objectives are inconsistent, although maximum completion time is part of the average completion time. In this paper, we propose a novel objective for flowshop production and a state space with head, body and tail (SS-HBT) heuristic to balance such inconsistency between the two objectives. Through case studies, we show that our SS-HBT heuristic outperforms two well-established heuristics in flowshop production scheduling. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={This paper presents a multi-strategy ensemble artificial bee colony (MEABC) algorithm for solving large-scale production scheduling problem. MEABC is a new variant of artificial bee colony (ABC), which has shown good performance on many continuous optimisation problems. To apply MEABC to discrete production scheduling problem, the smallest position value (SPV) rule is employed. Moreover, a modified NEH-based population initialisation method is utilised for generating high-quality initial solutions. Experimental study is conducted on a set of 140 flow shop scheduling problems with the size from 20 × 5 to 2,000 × 100. Simulation results show that MEABC performs better than the NEH and ABC on all test instances. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Current computer network technologies would achieve highly-distributed manufacturing systems (HDMSs), where each computerized facility manages itself autonomously by communicating with other facilities. For HDMSs, we proposed a distributed scheduling method for flexible flow-shop production, where priority of each facility is updated with indirect decision making and information control performed by a communication protocol. This method is composed of processing flows for buffers and machines in production stages. The buffer performs time management in a stage and the machines in the same stage take actions based on the time managed by the buffer. This paper describes an improved method for job production, where no buffer exists and all machines play both roles as a buffer and a machine. In this method, all machines behave according to the processing flow obtained by integrating those for buffers and machines. This method was applied to a simple example and its feasibility was proven.},

abstract={The steelmaking-continuous casting (SCC) process, which consists of steelmaking, refining and continuous casting stage, is usually the critical process in iron and steel industry. This paper aims to propose a simulation method for the realistic hybrid flow shop scheduling problem resulting from the SCC process. A mathematic model based on a comprehensive investigation is built first. Then, a simulation method which can decide the time scope of production materials on each stage in the simulation initialization is presented. Additionally, the matching decision algorithm is employed to match the machines and production materials in the simulation running process. To evaluate the simulation method, numerical experiments are conducted with an 8 hours test instance generated according to a real-world production process. The results show that the simulation method is a feasible and effective method for production scheduling in SCC process. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={A production programming model is proposed through the application of a metaheuristic technique to achieve the reduction of the makespan. A company in the textile sector was chosen as a case study and a production programming methodology for hybrid-flexible flow shop configurations was developed with the coding of a simple genetic algorithm. The algorithm gives good quality results with very reasonable computational times and coefficients of variation of about 2% in relation to the values of the makespan. This model also shows a level of efficiency comparable to other applications found in the literature, in which evolutionary algorithms are used. It is concluded that from the encoding of the production system and its main restrictions, the genetic algorithm well performs production scheduling by reducing the makespan. © 2015, Centro de Informacion Tecnologica.

abstract={The flexible flow-shop scheduling problem (FFSSP) is an important branch of production scheduling, the flexible flow shop is a combination of two well-known machine environments, which are flow shops and parallel machines, and it is well known that this problem is NP-hard. The no-wait requirement is a phenomenon that may occur in flow shops, and it's prevent the jobs to wait between two successive machines (or stages), jobs must be processed from the start to finish, without any interruption on machines (or stages) or between them. Many different approaches have been applied to FFSSP with no-wait. In this research, two-stage no-wait flexible flow shop scheduling problem (NWFFSSP) has been solved using two meta-heuristics, which are Tabu Search (TS) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We solved the NWFFSSP with minimum makespan as a performance measure. The performance of the proposed algorithms are studied and compared with previous research results using the same problem data. The results of the study proposes the effective algorithm. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={For the flow-shops, where the machines' failure function is governed by the Weibull distribution, considering the maintenance strategy, a joint model of integrating run-based preventive maintenance (PM) and production scheduling is proposed under the uncertainty environment, in which the planned start times of jobs and the PM times are determined simultaneously. And, the makespan is selected as the quality robustness measure; the total delay of the jobs' start time is selected as the solution robustness measure. Then, a three-phase heuristic algorithm based on the priority list, surrogate measure, and local search is devised to solve the mathematic model. Experimental results demonstrate that the solution robustness can be significantly improved at the cost of very little degradation in quality robustness using our algorithm compared with the traditional way.

abstract={The Permutation Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (PFSP) is a typical example in Production Scheduling, which has attracted many researchers’ attention. This paper takes to the advantage of the swarm characteristic of Particle Swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to find the best particle in the solution space. The objective is to minimize the makespan. Firstly, the initial solution of the algorithm is generated by the famous heuristic NEH algorithm. The NEH algorithm was used to initialize the particle of global extreme values. Secondly, we take some optimized strategy to set the parameters, acceleration constant and nonlinear inertia weight strategy which based on random self-adaptively by means of chaos method for setting parameters. These optimized methods can avoid algorithm to be trapped in local optimum. At last, simulated results demonstrate that the hybrid PSO method is feasible and effective for the PFSP. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Production scheduling plays a vital role in the planning and operation of a manufacturing system. Better scheduling system has a significant impact on cost reduction and minimum work-in-process inventory. This work considers the problem of scheduling n/m/F/ΣCi using Decision Tree (DT) algorithm. Since this problem is known to be strongly NP-hard, this work proposes heuristic based methodology to solve it. The advantages of DT’s are that the dispatching rule is in the form of If-then else rules which are easily understandable by the shop floor people. The proposed approach is tested on benchmark problems available in the literature and compared. The proposed work is a complement to the traditional methods. © 2015, Strojarski Facultet.

abstract={Scheduling ‘n’ jobs on ‘m’ machines in a flow shop is NP- hard problem and places itself at prominent place in the area of production scheduling. The essence of any scheduling algorithm is to minimize the makespan in a flowshop environment. In this paper an attempt has been made to develop a heuristic algorithm, based on the reduced weightage of ma-chines at each stage to generate different combination of ‘m-1’ sequences. The proposed heuristic has been tested on several benchmark problems of Taillard (1993) [Taillard, E. (1993). Benchmarks for basic scheduling problems. European Journal of Operational Research, 64, 278-285.]. The performance of the proposed heuristic is compared with three well-known heuristics, namely Palmer’s heuristic, Campbell’s CDS heuristic, and Dannenbring’s rapid access heuristic. Results are evaluated with the best-known upper-bound solutions and found better than the above three. © 2014 Growing Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Most research in production scheduling is concerned with the optimization of a single criterion. However, the analysis of the performance of a schedule often involves more than one aspect and therefore requires a multi-objective treatment. Therefore, in this research, the author makes use of one of the multiple objective decision-making methods, the min-max technique, to develop a new hybrid metaheuristic for solving sequence-dependent setup time hybrid flowshop scheduling problems with consideration of two performance measures, namely the makespan and the sum of the earliness and tardiness, simultaneously. In formulation of min-max type, the decision maker can have the flexibility of mixed use of weights and distance parameter in expressing desired improvement on produced Pareto optimal solutions. The proposed hybrid approach comprises two components: an electromagnetism-like algorithm and a tabu search to improve it. An extensive computational experience is carried out in order to analyze the different parameters of the combined algorithm. The comparison in the chapter shows the proposal to be very efficient for different structure instances. © 2015, IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper studies a solar cell industry scheduling problem, which is similar to traditional hybrid flowshop scheduling (HFS). In a typical HFS problem, the allocation of machine resources for each order should be scheduled in advance. However, the challenge in solar cell manufacturing is the number of machines that can be adjusted dynamically to complete the job. An optimal production scheduling model is developed to explore these issues, considering the practical characteristics, such as hybrid flowshop, parallel machine system, dedicated machines, sequence independent job setup times and sequence dependent job setup times. The objective of this model is to minimise the makespan and to decide the processing sequence of the orders/lots in each stage, lot-splitting decisions for the orders and the number of machines used to satisfy the demands in each stage. From the experimental results, lot-splitting has significant effect on shortening the makespan, and the improvement effect is influenced by the processing time and the setup time of orders. Therefore, the threshold point to improve the makespan can be identified. In addition, the model also indicates that more lot-splitting approaches, that is, the flexibility of allocating orders/lots to machines is larger, will result in a better scheduling performance. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Based on the constraints and frame conditions given by the real processes the production in bakeries can be modelled as a no-wait permutation flow-shop, following the definitions in scheduling theory. A modified genetic algorithm, ant colony optimization and a random search procedure were used to analyse and optimize the production planning of a bakery production line that processes 40 products on 26 production stages. This setup leads to 8.2 × 10 47 different possible schedules in a permutation flow-shop model and is thus not solvable in reasonable time with exact methods. Two objective functions of economical interest were analysed, the makespan and the total idle time of machines. In combination with the created model, the applied algorithms proved capable to provide optimized results for the scheduling operation within a predefined runtime of 15 min, reducing the makespan by up to 8.6% and the total idle time of machines by up to 23%. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In this work a predictive-reactive approach is applied for generating productive schedules and its application is suggested in ceramic companies that, following a traditional static approach, they need to keep this information as a beginning of its decisional process, in order to coordinate material delivering from providers, to carry out a close/fine capacity adjustment, transport planning, etc. but they also need to face unexpected changes adapting the initial schedule. Uncertainty is an aspect few times considered in literature despite of being present in most of manufacturing processes. In order to facilitate companies a new framework that allows tackling uncertainty, a new proposal aligned with a predictivereactive view and which can constitute a useful tool for this kind of companies is presented. Once the framework established, this contribution is focus on methods to deal with reactive phase, which is less developed in the scientific field than predictive. Specific contributions which consider characteristic setups from ceramic industry and others related to different environments are included. Obtained results illustrate a productivity improvement by applying simple methods.},

abstract={This paper investigates an integrated bi-objective optimisation problem with non-resumable jobs for production scheduling and preventive maintenance in a two-stage hybrid flow shop with one machine on the first stage and m identical parallel machines on the second stage. Sequence-dependent set-up times and preventive maintenance (PM) on the first stage machine are considered. The scheduling objectives are to minimise the unavailability of the first stage machine and to minimise the makespan simultaneously. To solve this integrated problem, three decisions have to be made: determine the processing sequence of jobs on the first stage machine, determine whether or not to perform PM activity just after each job, and specify the processing machine of each job on the second stage. Due to the complexity of the problem, a multi-objective tabu search (MOTS) method is adapted with the implementation details. The method generates non-dominated solutions with several parallel tabu lists and Pareto dominance concept. The performance of the method is compared with that of a well-known multi-objective genetic algorithm, in terms of standard multi-objective metrics. Computational results show that the proposed MOTS yields a better approximation. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Firms heavily emphasise reducing carbon footprint, an area warranting further improvement. This study examines carbon footprint within the context of production scheduling. Two multi-objective scheduling problems involving economic-and environmental-related criteria are studied: (1) a batch-processing machine scheduling problem to minimise the total weighted tardiness and carbon footprint simultaneously; (2) a triple-criteria scheduling problem involving of a hybrid flow shop consisting of a batch-processing machine followed by two parallel-processing machines, in which the shop attempts to minimise the total weighted tardiness, carbon footprint and peak power. Since the above problems are treated as a true multi-objective optimisation problem, decision-makers should select a solution among the trade-off solutions provided in the Pareto-optimal set. Therefore, the non-dominated sorting-based genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is implemented, which identifies the set of approximate efficient schedules to both multi-objective scheduling problems. Moreover, an adaptive multi-objective genetic algorithm (AMGA) is developed to generate the reference Pareto front, which validates the results that are obtained using NSGA-II. Results of this study demonstrate both the effectiveness of AMGA in converging to the true Pareto-optimal set and the efficiency of NSGA-II. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.},

abstract={A real manufacturing system of an electronic company was mimicked by using a simulation model. The effects of dispatching rules and resources allocations on performance measures were explored. The results indicated that the dispatching rules of shortest processing time (SPT) and earliest due date are superior to the current rule of first in first out adopted by the company. A new combined rule, the smallest quotient of dividing shortest remaining processing time (SRPT) by SPT (SRPT/SPT_Min), has been proposed and demonstrated the best performance on mean tardiness time under the current resources situation. The results also showed that using fewer resources can increase their utilization, but it increases the risk of delivery tardiness as well, which in turn will damage the organization’s reputation in the long run. Some suggestions for future work were presented. © 2014 The Author(s).},

abstract={Focusing on the issue of the blocking flow shop scheduling problem (BFSP) where the objective is to minimize the maximam makespan, it is found that present researches have less concerned the learning effect and forgetting effect in production scheduling simultaneously, so, a scheduling model considering learning and forgetting effects of BFSP was established. Combining with the Pairwise-based local search, firefly algorithm was applied to solve the blocking flow shop scheduling problem of small batch production with learning and forgetting effects. Firefly algorithm was tested by Car instances and their scheduling model considering learning and forgetting effects. The massive simulation results indicate the feasibility and effectiveness of the advanced firefly algorithm. Learning effect can reduce the makespan and thus improve the production efficiency while forgetting effect will weaken the learning effect so as to increase the makespan. The influence of learning and forgetting effects in production scheduling is of objective existence and can't be ignored. ©, 2014, Shanghai Institute of Mechanical Engineering. All right reserved.},

abstract={The production in bakeries can be modelled as a no-wait permutation flow-shop based on the constraints and frame conditions given by the real production processes. A modified genetic algorithm, ant colony optimization and particle swarm optimization were used to analyse and optimize the production planning of a bakery production line that processes 40 products on 26 production stages. This setup leads to 8.2 × 1047 different possible schedules in a permutation flow-shop model and is thus not solvable in reasonable time with exact methods. The makespan of the production, an objective function of high economic interest, was analysed. In combination with the created model, the applied algorithms proved capable to provide optimized results for the scheduling operation within a restricted computational time of 15 min, reducing the makespan by up to 8.6 %.},

abstract={In many industries, production capacity diminishes as machine conditions deteriorate. Maintenance operations improve machine conditions, but also occupy potential production time, possibly delaying the customer orders. Therefore, one challenge is to determine the joint maintenance and production schedule to minimize the combined costs of maintenance and lost production over the long term. In this paper, we address the problem of integrated maintenance and production scheduling in a deteriorating multi-machine production system over multiple periods. Assuming that at the beginning of each period the demand becomes known and machine conditions are observable, we formulate a Markov decision process model to determine the maintenance plan and develop sufficient conditions guaranteeing its monotonicity in both machine condition and demand. We then formulate an integer programming model to find the maintenance and the production schedule in each period. Our computational results show that exploiting online condition monitoring information in maintenance and production decisions leads to 21% cost savings on average compared to a greedy heuristic and that the benefit of incorporating long-term information in making short-term decisions is highest in industries with medium failure rates. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={In a response to the increasing demand for sustainable production together with the reduction in reserves of energy commodities, more and more manufacturers begin to pay attention to energy consumption problem during the production process. This paper looks at one of the potential approaches to improve energy efficiency during production which is to perform production scheduling with a combined manufacturing efficient and environmentally-friendly objective. Flexible flow shops are focused in this work and peak load is considered as the environment-related factor. Existing research has been mainly focusing on the general formulation or framework to integrate the energy reduction objective into the traditional scheduling problem. However, there still remains much room for improving the efficiency and adaptability. This paper builds an efficient discrete time Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model, whose key idea is to reduce the number of binary integer variables. The major advantage of the proposed method is that a global optimal solution could be achieved without any compromise on computing efficiency. The applicability of the model has been validated through simulations and a comparison of discrete-time and continuous-time MIP formulations for this kind of problem is discussed.},

abstract={The characteristics of mould heat-treatment shop production scheduling were summarized. Under the dynamic arrival of jobs, the flow-shop batch scheduling problem with two-stage batch machine and constant processing time was researched. Aiming at the minimum makespan, a mixed integer programming mathematic model was built. The problem was proved as NP-hard and the lower bound of the optimal objective function was given. An optimization algorithm for solving large-scale problems was constructed. The upper and lower bounds of batches number were solved, and the mathematical model was designed to solve the optimal solution for given batches number. By comparing each solution obtained from the given batches number, the global optimal solution was obtained. For small-scale problem, through comparing with the solution obtained from the traditional branch and bound method, the algorithm was proved to get the optimal solution and have shorter computation time. For large-scale problems, multiple sets of data were randomly generated in the different production conditions to validate the algorithm and the results show the effectiveness of it.},

abstract={Recent development of computer network technologies is realizing highly-distributed manufacturing systems from the hardware point of view, where each facility is computerized and manages itself autonomously by communicating with other facilities. For this new type of manufacturing systems, a new discrete event simulation paradigm has been discussed, in which sorting of events is performed by exchanging messages about their occurrence times among the facilities. To make this paradigm beneficial enough, it is desirable that re-scheduling process performed after the simulation is carried out in a similar paradigm. We have developed some production scheduling methods for flexible flow-shop production of only one kind of products with just one stage. This paper presents an improved method which can be applied to flexible flow-shop of multiple kinds of products with multiple stages. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2014.},

abstract={Current research addresses the Permutation Flow Shop scheduling problem, characterized as Production Scheduling in Batch Process (PSBP) to minimize total time to complete the schedule (Makespan). A method to approach the problem of production scheduling is to turn it into Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and to solve it by using commercial mathematical programming packages. An electronic spreadsheet with user-friendly interface (ESUFI) was developed in Microsoft Excel. Results showed that it is possible to use ESUFI to solve small problems.},

abstract={This study propose a novel method for the integration of systematic preventive maintenance policies in hybrid flow shop scheduling. The proposed approach is inspired by the behavior of the human body. We have implemented a problem-solving approach for optimizing the processing time, methods based on Métaheuristiques. This hybridization is between a Multi agent system and inspirations of the human body, especially artificial immune system. The effectiveness of our approach has been demonstrated repeatedly in this study. The proposed approach is applied to three preventive maintenance policies. These policies are intended to maximize the availability or to maintain a minimum level of reliability during the production chain. The results show that our algorithm outperforms existing algorithms. We assumed that the machines might be unavailable periodically during the production scheduling. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2014.},

abstract={Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a novel metaheuristic, which has been applied in a wide variety of production scheduling problems. Two basic characteristics of this algorithm are its efficiency and effectiveness in providing high-quality solutions. In order to improve the traditional PSO, this study proposes the incorporation of a local search heuristic into the basic PSO algorithm. The new, hybrid, metaheuristic is called "twin particle swarm optimization (TPSO)". The proposed metaheuristic scheme is applied to a flow shop with multiprocessors scheduling problem, which can be considered a real world case regarding the production line. This study, as far as the multiprocessors flow shop production system is concerned, utilizes sequence dependent setup times as constraints. Finally, simulated data confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm. The data test results indicate that TPSO has potential to replace PSO and become a significant heuristic algorithm for similar problems. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this paper, a time-window-based hybrid flow-shop scheduling model is presented for manufacturing enterprise for solving production scheduling optimisation problem in the rolling production process. Time window deviation sum and the earliness/tardiness (E/T) penalty sum's optimisation goal are modelled, and differential evolution (DE) global optimisation algorithm is used to conduct the global optimisation. The assigned tasks to determine a job's machining path in the time window frame can be finished in each stage. The hybrid flow-shop scheduling optimisation method based on time window can improve the equipment utilisation and reduce scheduling conflict situations. Our time-window-based hybrid flow-shop scheduling optimisation method is evaluated by multiple sets of programs' numerical analysis, and the results show that the proposed approach can meet the requirement of business rolling production scheduling very well.Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The permutation flow shop scheduling problem (PFSSP) is part of production scheduling, which belongs to the hardest combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper, a multipopulation particle swarm optimization (PSO) based memetic algorithm (MPSOMA) is proposed in this paper. In the proposed algorithm, the whole particle swarm population is divided into three subpopulations in which each particle evolves itself by the standard PSO and then updates each subpopulation by using different local search schemes such as variable neighborhood search (VNS) and individual improvement scheme (IIS). Then, the best particle of each subpopulation is selected to construct a probabilistic model by using estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and three particles are sampled from the probabilistic model to update the worst individual in each subpopulation. The best particle in the entire particle swarm is used to update the global optimal solution. The proposed MPSOMA is compared with two recently proposed algorithms, namely, PSO based memetic algorithm (PSOMA) and hybrid particle swarm optimization with estimation of distribution algorithm (PSOEDA), on 29 well-known PFFSPs taken from OR-library, and the experimental results show that it is an effective approach for the PFFSP. © 2013 Ruochen Liu et al.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a modeling approach for the NP-hard scheduling problem Job-shop with reverse flows. This problem is characterized by two flows that cover the same machines but in opposite senses. The objective is to minimize the maximum completion time of the jobs. We start by providing a mathematical formulation and we analyze the complexity and some particular cases of the problem. Then, we propose a heuristic method for solving the NP-hard 3-machine case, which we evaluate by conducting tests on Taillard's benchmark. These tests give satisfying results and show that the heuristic ensures good performance when the two flows have close numbers of jobs. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={One of the biggest bottlenecks in iron and steel production is the steelmaking-continuous casting (SCC) process, which consists of steel-making, refining and continuous casting. The production scheduling of SCC is a complex hybrid flowshop (HFS) scheduling with following features: job grouping and precedence constraints, no dead time inside the same group of jobs, setup time constraints on the casters. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is established with the objective of minimizing the total weighted penalties of the earliness/tardiness and the job waiting. Through relaxing the operation precedence constraints to the objective function, the relaxed problem can be decomposed into to smaller subproblems, each of which corresponds a specific stage. A new dynamic programming algorithm is developed for solving the subproblems which are parallel machine scheduling problem with objective of minimizing total weighted completion time where the weights of jobs may be negative. The Lagrangian dual problem is solved by an improved subgradient level algorithm which can guarantee global convergence. A novel heuristic is presented to adjust subproblem solutions to obtain a feasible schedule. The computational results demonstrate that the propose LR approach can generate a high quality schedule within an acceptable computation time. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In many practical scheduling problems, the concerns of the decision-maker may not be all known in advance and therefore may not be included in the initial problem definition as an objective function and/or as constraints. In such a case, the usual techniques of multi-objective optimization become inapplicable. To cope with this problem and to facilitate handling the concerns of the decision-maker, which can be implicit or qualitative, a dedicated methodological framework is needed. In this paper we propose a new two-step framework. First, we aim at obtaining a set of schedules that can be considered efficient with respect to a performance measure and at the same time different enough from one another to enable flexibility in the final choice. We formalize this new problem and suggest to address it with a multimodal optimization approach. Niching considerations are discussed for common scheduling problems. Through the flexibility induced with this approach, the additional considerations can be taken into account in a second step, which allows decision-makers to select an appropriate schedule among a set of sound schedules (in contrast to common optimization approaches, where usually a single solution is obtained and it is final). The proposed two-step approach can be used to handle a wide range of underlying scheduling problems. To show its potential and benefits we illustrate the framework on a set of hybrid flow shop instances that have been previously studied in the literature. We develop a multimodal genetic algorithm that employs an adapted version of the restricted tournament selection for niching purposes in the first step. The second step takes into account additional concerns of the decision-maker related to the ability of the schedules to absorb the negative effects due to random machine breakdowns. Our computational experiments indicate that the proposed framework is capable of generating numerous high-performance (mostly optimal) schedules. Additionally, our computational results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides the decision-maker a high flexibility in dealing with subsequent side concerns, since there are drastic differences in the capabilities of the efficient solutions found in Step 1 to absorb the negative impacts of machine breakdowns. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The traditional production scheduling problem considers performance indicators such as processing time, cost, and quality as optimization objectives in manufacturing systems; however, it does not take energy consumption or environmental impacts completely into account. Therefore, this paper proposes an energy-efficient model for flexible flow shop scheduling (FFS). First, a mathematical model for a FFS problem, which is based on an energy-efficient mechanism, is described to solve multi-objective optimization. Since FFS is well known as a NP-hard problem, an improved, genetic-simulated annealing algorithm is adopted to make a significant trade-off between the makespan and the total energy consumption to implement a feasible scheduling. Finally, a case study of a production scheduling problem for a metalworking workshop in a plant is simulated. The experimental results show that the relationship between the makespan and the energy consumption may be apparently conflicting. In addition, an energy-saving decision is performed in a feasible scheduling. Using the decision method, there could be significant potential for minimizing energy consumption. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Flow-shop problems, as a typical manufacturing challenge, have become an interesting area of research. The primary concern is that the solution space is huge and, therefore, the set of feasible solutions cannot be enumerated one by one. In this paper, we present an efficient solution strategy based on a genetic algorithm (GA) to minimize the makespan, total waiting time and total tardiness in a flow shop consisting of n jobs and m machines. The primary objective is to minimize the job waiting time before performing the related operations. This is a major concern for some industries such as food and chemical for planning and production scheduling. In these industries, there is a probability of the decay and deterioration of the products prior to accomplishment of operations in workstation, due to the increase in the waiting time. We develop a model for a flowshop scheduling problem, which uses the planner-specified weights for handling a multi-objective optimization problem. These weights represent the priority of planning objectives given by managers. The results of the proposed GA and classic GA are analyzed by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method and the results are discussed. © 2013 Growing Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Models representing batch plants, especially flowshop facilities where all the products require the same processing sequence, have received much attention in the last decades. In particular, plant design and production scheduling have been addressed as disconnected problems due to the tremendous combinatory complexity associated to their simultaneous optimization. This paper develops a model for both design and scheduling of flowshop batch plants considering mixed product campaign and parallel unit duplication. Thus, a realistic formulation is attained, where industrial and commercial aspects are jointly taken into account. The proposed approach is formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model that determines the number of units per stages, unit and batch sizes and batch sequencing in each unit in order to fulfill the demand requirements at minimum investment cost. A set of novel constraints is proposed where the number of batches of each product in the campaign is an optimization variable. The approach performance is evaluated through several numerical examples. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Production scheduling often poses a huge challenge due to the ever-changing production environment and competitive global market. The changes result to various layout design modifications from simple flow line and job shop to hybrid flow shop (HFS). This research is conducted to determine a scheduling rule suitable for the HFS production area. Simple and combined priority dispatching rules are tested to identify the most effective rule in producing products on time and to avoid penalties caused by production delay. WITNESS software is utilised to develop the production line layout model and to simulate scheduling rules. The rules are then analysed through one-way analysis of variance. Newman-Keul's test is performed to compare the significant difference of each rule from the others. Analysis shows that the shortest imminent rule is the most significant rule that can be implemented in the production environment to achieve effective scheduling and maximised throughput.

abstract={This research focuses on a parallel machines scheduling problem considering lot streaming which is similar to the traditional hybrid flow shop scheduling (HFS). In a typical HFS with parallel machines problem, the allocation of machine resources for each order should be determined in advance. In addition, the size of each sublot is splited by parallel machines configuration. However, allocation of machine resources, sublot size and lot sequence are highly mutual influence. If allocation of machine resources has been determined, adjustment on production sequence is unable to reduce production makespan. Without splitting a given job into sublots, the production scheduling cannot have overlapping of successive operations in multi-stage parallel machines environment thereby contributing to the best production scheduling. Therefore, this research motivated from a solar cell industry is going to explore these issues. The multi-stage and parallel-machines scheduling problem in the solar cell industry simultaneously considers the optimal sublot size, sublot sequence, parallel machines sublot scheduling and machine configurations through dynamically allocating all sublot to parallel machines. We formulate this problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model considering the practical characteristics including parallel machines, dedicated machines, sequence-independent setup time, and sequence-dependent setup time. A hybrid-coded particle swarm optimization (HCPSO) is developed to find a nearoptimal solution. At the end of this study, the result of this research will compare with the optimization method of mixed integer linear programming and case study. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013.},

abstract={This article aims to make a diagnosis to production scheduling system in a company dedicated to metal coating with electrostatic paint. One of the most common problems in the operation management is to determinate the optimal sequence to execute in a command set or in an order batch (order lots) seeking to minimize the times of use and set up of each machine. Considering the efficient allocation, this problem concerns to schedule a set of tasks that needs to be done for one or a group of machines arranged in correct sequence; this "Sequencing problem" considered a NP (complex) when the number of machines is greater than or equal to 3. Every single task follows the same route of manufacturing; where a machine cannot process more than one task at the same time. The assessment of production orders with subdivisions, provides the initial stage of the characterization and diagnosis of the production; under this conception those tasks that minimize the speed of the production flow were identified (Bottleneck). The research results show that there are problems in the processing and delivery of the finished material.},

abstract={The paper presents a two-level relaxation heuristic for production planning for multistage flowshop systems with intermediate buffers. The method concerns unidirectional multistage systems where tasks with respect to many various types of products are performed simultaneously. The fixed and the alternative production routes are regarded in the method. The top-level is a stage loading, i.e., allocation of tasks among the stages. The base-level is a task scheduling - allocation of tasks among the stations. The linear mathematical models of mixed integer programming are used in the method. The time criterion is used in the minimization functions - the minimal schedule is fixed. The condition that variables are to be integers has been ignored in the heuristic. The relaxed heuristic developed in such a manner enables obtaining good results in a very short time. This paper discusses the multilevel approach as the developed production scheduling method serves the purpose of solving relatively large problems. Results of computational experiments with the proposed heuristic method are presented.},

abstract={This research focuses on the flow shop production scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times. The study reviews and analyses the methods used in the literature to solve this problem. The analyses were performed using the number of papers published during the study period, the approach used to develop solution methods, the type of objective function and performance criterion adopted, and the additional constraints considered. It were identified and analysed 83 papers that address the flow shop scheduling problem with setup times separated from processing times. The results of the review and analysis showed several opportunities for future research on this topic, including 1 working with setups dependent on batch sequences 2 using bi- and multi-criteria functions related to the flow time objective 3 adding practical constraints faced by production systems.

abstract={In this paper, we contemplate the problem of scheduling a set of n jobs in a no-wait flexible flow shop manufacturing system with sequence dependent setup times to minimising the maximum completion time. With respect to NP-hardness of the considered problem, there seems to be no avoiding application of metaheuristic approaches to achieve near-optimal solutions for this problem. For this reason, three novel metaheuristic algorithms, namely population based simulated annealing (PBSA), adapted imperialist competitive algorithm (AICA) and hybridisation of adapted imperialist competitive algorithm and population based simulated annealing (AICA+PBSA), are developed to solve the addressed problem. Because of the sensitivity of our proposed algorithm to parameter's values, we employed the Taguchi method as an optimisation technique to extensively tune different parameters of our algorithm to enhance solutions accuracy. These proposed algorithms were coded and tested on randomly generated instances, then to validate the effectiveness of them computational results are examined in terms of relative percentage deviation. Moreover, some sensitive analyses are carried out for appraising the behaviour of algorithms versus different conditions. The computational evaluations manifestly support the high performance of our proposed novel hybrid algorithm against other algorithms which were applied in literature for related production scheduling problems. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={In the literature, many evolutionary algorithms have been proposed for the production scheduling problems such as genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, and so on. However, these algorithms mainly focus on the efficiency of local search methods but seldom tackle the control of population diversity. Therefore, this paper aims to check whether the population diversity control strategy can significantly impact the performance of evolutionary algorithms for the production scheduling problems. With this aim in mind, a population diversity control strategy was proposed and applied in a basic evolutionary algorithm. The computational results on two representative production scheduling problems, i.e., the single machine scheduling and the permutation flowshop scheduling, show that the proposed population diversity control strategy can significantly improve the basic evolutionary algorithm and that this algorithm with the strategy (but without local search) can even be competitive with other powerful evolutionary algorithms with local search in the literature. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we present fuzzy scheduling approach to the modern engineering and industrial manufacturing units. These units are facing lots of problems in many aspects such as processing time of jobs, setup time of machines, raw material, man power, electricity and customer's constraints. In a real production scheduling environment, there exist various internal or external uncertainties, due to incomplete knowledge or uncertain production environment, it is often difficult to model all parameters in the scheduling system with crisp values. When a new job starts processing, such a complex problem of vagueness and uncertainties can be handled by the theory of fuzzy logic. Here, we propose fuzzy model with flexible constraints imposed on the processing capacity. The task is to find a schedule which achieves maximum level of satisfaction as well as minimal setup and holding cost. Fuzzy flow shop scheduling problem (FSSP) is solved by using Fuzzy Triangular Membership Function (FTMF).},

abstract={Flow shop problem which is known as a well-known combinatorial optimization problem, is very important scheduling decision in field of production management. This paper aims at minimizing the maximum completion time (makespan) in a flow shop production environment when batch-processing machines are available. A batch-processing machine is a type of machine that can process a batch of jobs (orders) as long as its capacity is not exceeded. The batch processing time is also the longest processing time of all of the jobs in that particular batch. In suggested model, the processing times and the job sizes are assumed to be non-identical. Such problem have many applications in different industrial environments such as the burn-in operation in the manufacture of semiconductors and the aging test operation in the manufacture of thin film transistor-liquid crystal displays. A mixed integer programming model is suggested to formulate the problem mathematically. Since the current problem is known to be computationally complex, hybrid genetic algorithms (HGAs) are devised to achieve optimal/near optimal solutions. In order to prove the high effectiveness of proposed algorithms, a set of random instances are generated, and then HGAs are compared with traditional algorithm. All the experimental results show that HGAs are more effective than traditional algorithm for the considered problem. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers.},

abstract={The integrated production scheduling and lot-sizing problem in a flow shop environment consists of establishing production lot sizes and allocating machines to process them within a planning horizon in a production line with machines arranged in series. The problem considers that demands must be met without backlogging, the capacity of the machines must be respected, and machine setups are sequence-dependent and preserved between periods of the planning horizon. The objective is to determine a production schedule to minimise the setup, production and inventory costs. A mathematical model from the literature is presented, as well as procedures for obtaining feasible solutions. However, some of the procedures have difficulty in obtaining feasible solutions for large-sized problem instances. In addition, we address the problem using different versions of the Asynchronous Team (A-Team) approach. The procedures were compared with literature heuristics based on Mixed Integer Programming. The proposed A-Team procedures outperformed the literature heuristics, especially for large instances. The developed methodologies and the results obtained are presented. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The complication of quartz process leads to the difficulty of its production scheduling. This paper models the scheduling in quartz production as a flexible routing based flowshop scheduling problem with two objectives. Each job may have one or more process routes, i.e., a job operation may choose one equipment or skilled worker among a set of qualified ones with same function but perhaps with different processing speed or costs. The proposed model is a mixed-integer program: processing costs and tardiness charges. A dedicated Genetic Algorithm is designed with heuristics mechanism to solve the model. The simulated computation shows that the proposed model and the algorithm are feasible and effective for the flexible routing based flowshop scheduling problem. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In the literature, earliness/tardiness (E/T) problem was known as weighted absolute deviation problem, and both tardiness and earliness is very important performance criteria for scheduling problem. While total tardiness criteria provides adaptation for due date (ignoring results of earliness done jobs), it deals with only cost of tardiness. However this phenomenon has been started to change with just-in-time (JIT) production concept. On JIT production, earliness is as important as tardiness. The phenomenon of the learning effect has been extensively studied in many different areas of operational research. However, there have been a few studies in the general context of production scheduling such as flow-shop scheduling. This paper addresses the minimization of the total earliness/tardiness penalties under learning effects in a two-machine flow-shop scheduling problem. Jobs have a common due date. We present mathematical model to obtain an optimal schedule for a given job sequence. We also present heuristics that use genetic algorithm and tabu search, based on proposed properties. Furthermore, random search was used for showing the significance of the study by comparison purpose. A new set of benchmark problems is presented with the purpose of evaluating the heuristics. The experimental results show that the performance of proposed approach is quite well, especially for the instances of large size. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

abstract={Lot streaming is a fundamental production scheduling technique to squeeze manufacturing lead times by splitting a large lot of n identical items into sublots. This article presents a full characterization of optimal solutions for two-stage lot streaming with attached machine setup times to minimize the makespan. An O(n3) time dynamic programming algorithm is presented for the discrete variant of the problem, in which all sublot sizes need to be integral. Since this running time can be prohibitively long for larger n, the continuous variant is also analyzed and an O(n) time algorithm for its solution is presented. Also, rounding procedures for the optimal continuous solution to obtain an approximate solution for the discrete problem are designed and analyzed. It is shown that a particular class of rounding procedures, using dynamic programming, has a compelling absolute worst-case and empirical performance. © 2012 "IIE".},

abstract={Generally the decisions in different levels of supply chain are considered independently while the feasibility of operational decisions greatly depends on the accuracy of forecasts in strategic level. In this study, a production scheduling problem is considered integrated with a capacity planning problem. This problem addresses a coordination issue in supply chain area between a tactical and an operational decision process. A flow shop environment with resource allocation are regarded in which the processing time of a job depends on the amount of several types of additional resources should be assigned to that job in planning stage. In order to minimize a combination of maximum completion time and required amount of resources, a decomposition approach is suggested that strives to tackle the main problem via two subproblems: job sequencing problem and capacity planning problem. A hybrid evolutionary algorithm is then devised to achieve the accurate schedule of jobs as well as appropriate allocation of resources. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.},

abstract={Production scheduling with flexible resources is critical and challenging in many modern manufacturing firms. This paper applies the nested partitions (NP) framework to solve the flexible resource flow shop scheduling (FRFS) problem using an efficient hybrid NP algorithm. By considering the domain knowledge, the ordinal optimisation principle and the NEH heuristics are integrated into the partitioning scheme to search the feasible region. An efficient resource-allocation procedure is built into the sampling scheme for the FRFS problem. A large number of benchmark examples with flexible resources are tested. The test results show that the hybrid NP algorithm is more efficient than either generic NP or heuristics alone. The algorithm developed in this study is capable of selecting the most promising region for a manufacturing system with a high degree of accuracy. The algorithm is efficient and scalable for large-scale problems. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={In this paper, multi-objective flow-shop scheduling with parallel machines is considered, and an algorithm for production-scheduling optimisation is proposed. The objective is to design an algorithm to optimise production scheduling, taking into consideration customer changes to delivery dates and quantities, materials requisitioned from the supplier and inventory management. Manufacturing lead time for the production order is minimised, and, finally, resource use is considered as an auxiliary criterion. Numerical examples, modelled with data from a Mexican enterprise, and computational results are reported. The paper indicates that the mathematical model, as well as the program that solves it, provides flexibility with minimum modifications. Thus it can provide useful information for multiple decision processes. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Resource allocation, product batching and production scheduling are three different problems in manufacturing systems of different structures such as flexible flow shop manufacturing systems. These problems are usually dealt with independently for a certain objective function related to production efficiency and effectiveness. Handling all of them in an integrated manner is a challenge facing many manufacturing systems in practice and that challenge increases for highly complicated and stochastic systems. Random arrival of products, machine setup time requirements, unexpected machine breakdowns, and multiple conflicting objective functions are some of the common complications in such systems. This research attempts to study the integrated problem under the mentioned complications with various objective functions. The decisions parameters are the batch size, the number of machines at each workstation, and the dispatching policy. Discrete event simulation is used as an optimization tools. The system is modeled using the ARENA software and different scenarios are tested for optimum parameter selection under different conditions. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.},

abstract={Generally, production planning includes production scheduling and preventive maintenance, and they are activities that are inter-reliant to production system but often performed separately. Recently a few scholars have studied the integrated preventive maintenance and production scheduling for a single machine, thus this study proposes an integrated model that simultaneously determines production scheduling and preventive maintenance policies in a two-machine flow shop to improve production performance by means of minimizing the total weighted tardiness cost of jobs. This study demonstrates the benefits of integration by a numerical example, and compares the integrated solution with the solution obtained from solving the production scheduling and preventive maintenance problems separately. A large samples simulation experiment shows that the two models are significant different, where the penalty cost resulted from tardiness of the integrated model is smaller than that from the non-integrated model. The sensitivity analysis shows that the preventive maintenance processing time, the repair time, and the shape parameter of the Weibull distribution are the three parameters that influence the penalty cost. Among the three parameters, the repair time has a most significant impact on the penalty cost.},

abstract={This paper describes the development of an intelligent search strategy for solving the three-machine flow-shop scheduling problem. The method involved is based on a heuristic search algorithm SLA* (Search and Learning A*) which was derived and improved from the IDA * (Iterative Deepening A*) algorithm developed by Korf in 1985. In addition to solving the three-machine flow-shop scheduling problem, we have also developed an important improvement related to the calculation of heuristic estimates during the search process. The development of this algorithm will contribute significantly to software development for many industrial problems especially in production scheduling, shop floor scheduling, load balancing in operating systems and reducing congestion in data communication.},

abstract={A flowshop scheduling problem has been one of the classical problems in production scheduling since Johnson proposed the well-known Johnson's rule in the two-stage flow-shop make-span scheduling problem. Mitten and Johnson (1959) separately gave solution algorithm of obtaining an optimal sequence for an 'n-job, 2-machine' flow shop scheduling problem in which each job involves arbitrary time lags (start-lag, stop-lag). Also Maggu and Das (1980) gives solution algorithm of obtaining optimal sequence for a ' n-job, 2-machine' flow shop scheduling problem where in each job involves transportation time. Johnson (1959) presented a solution to the n-job, 2-machine flow-shop problem with an algorithm that produces an ordered sequence with minimum total elapsed time. Kim and Bobrowski (1994) present a computer simulation model for a limited machine job shop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times. They study the influence of setup times and due date's information in priority rules performance for job-shop problem with setup times. S. M. Johnson (1954) presents optimal two and three stage production schedules with setup time included. Wlodzimierz Szwarc (1986) discussed the flow shop problem with time lags and separated setup times. C.T. Ng et al. (2007) presents the three-machine flow- shop scheduling problem to minimize maximum lateness with separate setup times. W. H. Yang et al. (1999) addressed a survey of scheduling research involving setup times. An overall view on set up times in sequencing problems is presented. In this paper, we addressed the three machine flow shop scheduling problem to minimize total completion time where setup times are treated as separate from processing times. Two cases are studied, taking into consideration these factors and the set up times separated from the processing times. This new algorithm provides an optimal scheduling sequence for flow-shop scheduling problems of 5-jobs on 3-machines and is proposed by using separated setup times of a job. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This work deals with production scheduling problem in an assembly flow shop, having parts machining followed by their subsequent assembly operations. Limited heuristics available on the problem, are based on unrealistic assumption that every part is processed on all machines. In this paper, two heuristics NEH_BB and Disjunctive are proposed to solve assembly flow shop scheduling problem where every part may not be processed on each machine. Exhaustive computational experiments are conducted with 60 trials each. The methods are found to be applicable to large size problems. The objective functions used for comparison are makespan and computational time. Disjunctive method takes very less computational time as compared to NEH_BB and hence claimed to be the better among available approaches for finding solution in assembly flow shop problems. © 2012 Growing Science Ltd.

abstract={Manufacturing systems in real-world production are generally dynamic and often subject to a wide range of uncertainties. Recently, research on production scheduling under uncertainty has attracted substantial attention. Although some methods have been developed to address this problem, scheduling under uncertainty remains inherently difficult to solve by any single approach. This article considers makespan optimisation of a flexible flow shop (FFS) scheduling problem under machine breakdown. It proposes a novel decomposition-based approach to decompose an FFS scheduling problem into several cluster scheduling problems which can be solved more easily by different approaches. A neighbouring K-means clustering algorithm is developed to first group the machines of an FFS into an appropriate number of machine clusters, based on a proposed machine allocation algorithm and weighted cluster validity indices. Two optimal back propagation networks, corresponding to the scenarios of simultaneous and non-simultaneous job arrivals, are then selectively adopted to assign either the shortest processing time (SPT) or the genetic algorithm (GA) to each machine cluster to solve cluster scheduling problems. If two neighbouring machine clusters are allocated with the same approach, they are subsequently merged. After machine grouping and approach assignment, an overall schedule is generated by integrating the solutions to the sub-problems.

abstract={Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) and Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (FSSP) are strong NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems among class of typical production scheduling problems. An improved Sheep Flock Heredity Algorithm (ISFHA) is proposed in this paper to find a schedule of operations that can minimize makespan. In ISFHA, the pairwise mutation operation is replaced by a single point mutation process with a probabilistic property which guarantees the feasibility of the solutions in the local search domain. A Robust-Replace (R-R) heuristic is introduced in place of chromosomal crossover to enhance the global search and to improve the convergence. The R-R heuristic is found to enhance the exploring potential of the algorithm and enrich the diversity of neighborhoods. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, whose optimization performance is markedly superior to that of genetic algorithms and is comparable to the best results reported in the literature. © 2011 Growing Science Ltd.

abstract={Multi-objective optimisation problems have seen a large impulse in the last decades. Many new techniques for solving distinct variants of multi-objective problems have been proposed. Production scheduling, as with other operations management fields, is no different. The flowshop problem is among the most widely studied scheduling settings. Recently, the Iterated Greedy methodology for solving the single-objective version of the flowshop problem has produced state-of-the-art results. This paper proposes a new algorithm based on Iterated Greedy technique for solving the multi-objective permutation flowshop problem. This algorithm is characterised by an effective initialisation of the population, management of the Pareto front, and a specially tailored local search, among other things. The proposed multi-objective Iterated Greedy method is shown to outperform other recent approaches in comprehensive computational and statistical tests that comprise a large number of instances with objectives involving makespan, tardiness and flowtime. Lastly, we use a novel graphical tool to compare the performances of stochastic Pareto fronts based on Empirical Attainment Functions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop a new approach called advanced overlapping production planning (AOPP) model which considers multi-site process selection, sequential constraints, and capacity constraints in a manufacturing supply chain environment (MSCE). AOPP model may determine the capacity plan and order margin allocation for each site and machines in an MSCE and provide the capacity information for a production planner to effectively adjust the production strategies (e.g. outsourcing, overtime, or adding a work shift) of overloading resources. Design/methodology/approach: First, an AOPP model is presented to model the production scheduling problem in a supply chain with the objective of minimizing the fulfilling cycle time of each order and the overloads of each machine group. Second, a genetic algorithm (GA)-based approach for solving the AOPP model is developed. Finally, a heuristic adjustment approach is proposed for planners to adjust the production plan whenever there is an exception of production occurring. Findings The production schedule obtained from the GA-based AOPP approach retains order margins in each operation against other overlapping operations, and it satisfies the capacity constraints of each machine group in an MSCE and results in a better performance in process planning and production planning with finite capacity. In practice, the overloading problem can be solved by adding a work shift or working overtime. The GA-based AOPP model provides useful information for production planners to make such decisions. Practical implications - Production planners need a more flexible production plan with order margins to compensate for the uncertainties which frequently occur in the supply and demand sides. This research develops a model to help planners manage the order margin of production planning in an MSCE and showing that order margins become a crucial factor for achieving effective production objective in terms of short OTD (or order cycle) time. Originality/value: The overlapping production planning approach is a useful finite capacity planning approach for handling the capacity and order margin management in certain manufacturing environment (e.g. flow shop), but less on overcoming multi-site process selection, sequential constraints, and capacity constraints in an MSCE. In addition, the capacity plan and order margin allocation information for each site and facilities are very important for a planner to effectively adjust the production strategies (e.g. outsourcing, overtime, or adding a work shift) of overloading resources. This research addresses both issues. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This paper considers a two-stage production scheduling problem in which each activity requires two operations to be processed in stages 1 and 2, respectively. There are two options for processing each operation: the first is to produce it by utilizing in-house resources, while the second is to outsource it to a subcontractor. For in-house operations, a schedule is constructed and its performance is measured by the makespan, that is, the latest completion time of operations processed in-house. Operations by subcontractors are instantaneous but require outsourcing cost. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum of the makespan and the total outsourcing cost. This paper analyzes how the model's computational complexity changes according to unit outsourcing costs in both stages and describes the boundary between NP-hard and polynomially solvable cases. Finally, this paper presents an approximation algorithm for one NP-hard case. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In the real world, production scheduling systems, usually optimal job scheduling, requires an explicit consideration of sequence-dependent setup times. One of the most important scheduling criteria in practical systems is makespan. In this paper, the author presents an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm for the sequence-dependent permutation flowshop scheduling problem. The proposed ACO algorithm benefits from a new approach for computing the initial pheromone values and a local search. The proposed algorithm is tested on randomly generated problem instances and results indicate that it is very competitive with the existing best metaheuristics. © 2010 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

abstract={Although research in flow shop production scheduling has been carried out for many decades, there is still a gap between theoretical research and industrial applications - especially in some manufacturing paradigms in which adaptive production control is necessary, such as in one-of-a-kind production (OKP). This paper presents an average processing time and lever (APT-LVR) heuristic, integrated with a closed-loop feedback control scheme, to achieve adaptive production scheduling and control in flow shop production. Having been implemented in a local OKP company, our APT-LVR based production scheduling and control system demonstrates a significant potential to improve the company's production efficiency and competitiveness. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={In order to generate a fast, efficient and rational schedule for a production process to achieve an optimal production, a modified Particle Swarm Algorithm, the weights of Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (DPSO), were investigated. The study concentrated on the parameter settings for DPSO algorithm. Based on the traditional PSO algoridim, the weighting factors with dynamic and adaptive adjustment capabilities were introduced, which make the algorithm achieving global optimization faster, and also greatly reducing the number of iterations. The DPSO algorithm was used for flow-shop scheduling in process industries to greatly improve the efficiency of production. The simulation indicates that the algorithm has very good performance on global optimization. The results have a reference value to production scheduling.},

abstract={The hybrid flow shop scheduling with multiprocessor task (HFSMT) problem is a substantial production scheduling problem for minimizing the makespan, and there exist many difficulties in solving large scale HFSMT problems which include many jobs, machines and tasks. The HFSMT problems known as NP-hard and the proposal of an efficient genetic algorithm (GA) were taken into consideration in this study. The numerical results prove that the computational performance of a GA depends on the factors of initial solution, reproduction, crossover, and mutation operators and probabilities. The implementation details, including a new mutation operator, were described and a full factorial experimental design was determined with our GA program by using the best values of the control parameters and the operators. After a comparison was made with the studies of Ouz [1], Ouz and Ercan [2] and Kahraman et al. [3] related to the HFSMT problems, the computational results indicated that the proposed genetic algorithm approach is very effective in terms of reduced total completion time or makespan (Cmax) for the attempted problems. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={As to current situation of research on production scheduling under uncertainties in enterprises, Flow Shop production scheduling model is established based on the theory of fuzzy programming, in which fuzzy processing time is considered and the duration time of intermediate is unlimited. The maximum membership function of mean value has been applied to solve the non-linear fuzzy scheduling model in order to convert the fuzzy optimization problem to the general optimization problem. Finally, a cooperative co-evolutionary particle swarm optimization algorithm based on catastrophe added to improve the diversity of the swarm (CCPSO) is adopted to solve Flow Shop Production Scheduling Under Uncertainty within Infinite Intermediate Storage and results are obtained effectively.},

abstract={One of the most thoroughly studied scheduling assumptions is considering that machines may not be periodically available during the production scheduling. Although many researchers have made great attempts at integrating production and preventive maintenance scheduling by different methods, some of these methods are so intricate that one cannot independently code them to achieve the same effectiveness, or some strongly utilize specific features of the original considered problem that one cannot extend to other problems. This paper intends to apply integrating methods simple, yet easily extendible to any other machine scheduling problems. The paper investigates scheduling flexible flowshops subject to periodic preventive maintenance on machines. The objective is to minimize makespan. Two metaheuristics, including genetic algorithm and artificial immune system, and some constructive heuristics are developed to tackle the problem. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated by comparing their solutions. The results of the computational experiments indicate that the artificial immune system outperforms the other methods. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Most of research in production scheduling is concerned with the optimization of a single criterion. However the analysis of the performance of a schedule often involves more than one aspect and therefore requires a multi-objective treatment. In this research, with combination of two multiple objective decision-making methods, min-max and weighted techniques, a new solution presentation method and a robust hybrid metaheuristic, we solved sequence-dependent setup time hybrid flowshop scheduling problems. In this paper for reflecting real-world situation adequately, we assume the processing time of each job depends on the speed of machine and amount of resource allocated to each machine at the stage which is processed on it. In formulation of min-max type, the decision-maker can have the flexibility of mixed use of weights and distance parameter in expressing desired improvement on produced Pareto optimal solutions. To minimize makespan and total resource allocation costs, the proposed hybrid approach is robust, fast, and simply structured, and comprises two components: genetic algorithm and a variable neighborhood search. The comparison shows the proposal to be very efficient for different structure instances. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={One of the most important assumptions in production scheduling is that the machines are permanently available without any breakdown. In the real world of scheduling, machines can be made unavailable due to various reasons such as preventive maintenance and unpredicted breakdown. In this paper, we explore flowshop configuration under the assumption of condition-based maintenance to minimize expected makespan. Furthermore, we consider a condition-based maintenance (CBM) strategy which could be used in most industrial settings. The proposed algorithm is designed for non-resumable flowshop state where the processing of jobs after preventive maintenance is restarted from the beginning. We propose a hybrid algorithm based on genetic algorithm and simulated annealing. Additionally, we conduct an extensive parameter calibration with the utilization of Taguchi method and select the optimal levels of the algorithm's performance influential factors. The preliminary results indicate that the proposed method provides significantly better results compared with other high performing algorithms in the literature. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={This work presents a solution approach for a real scheduling problem in a bulletproof glass company in Colombia; this company is one of the three bulletproof glass production lines of one of the largest producers of this type of glass in the world. The production system of the production line can be modeled as a Flexible Flow Shop framework; the main features are: batch processing constraints, eligibility of machines and limited capacity of machines among others; the objective function tested was minimizing makespan. Due to the difficulty of modeling real industry problems, this work introduces a methodology which combines both modeling and scheduling using Petri Nets and Heuristics Search methods. Currently the production schedule is prepared by experts in the company who base their decisions primarily on their expertise. Preliminary results have showed improvements around of 5% in the objective function compared with the current practice.},

abstract={Due to a large amount of the retirement of experienced personnel, it is one of the most serious issues how the technical predominance of manufacturing industries can be maintained. From the viewpoint of problem-solving by experienced personnel, the acquisition and the utilization of additional and essential information might be crucial. According to this observation, in the paper, a kind of scheduling problems, i.e., a scheduling problem of the flexible flow shop type, is taken as an example of the problem-solving in manufacturing industries. Then, a mathematical programming-based approach is investigated, where two kinds of optimization models are formulated: One is the model of the solution by unskillful personnel in which only the common data is used, whereas the other is the solution model by experienced personnel in which some additional information is available. Furthermore, through some computational examples for the simplified scheduling problem of the flexible flow shop type, the potential of the experienced personnel model, i.e., the robustness of the obtained schedule for uncertain situations, has been confirmed.},

abstract={The scheduling of state-of-the-art equipment for manufacturing microelectronic circuitry on flexible substrates is considered. Three major processing steps are the following: vacuum deposition, photolithography, and photoresist development. Customers of this facility have different needs and thus have different processing time requirements, different due-dates, etc. The n-job, three machine flowshop problem, while relatively trivial for some performance measures, can be NP-complete for others (e.g., tardiness-based criteria). A scheduling tool to be used in conjunction with the Lekin ® software created at NYU is being developed. Data are entered for the scheduling instance, namely, the number of jobs, processing times, due-dates, weights, if applicable, and the performance measure of interest. Lekin-based files will then be created from the data and used as inputs into the Lekin software. Intelligence, in the form of heuristics, is being embedded into the system. For example, if the performance measure is makespan and it is determined that the maximum time on the photoresist tool is no greater than the minimum time on the other tools, then a special application of Johnson's Algorithm will identify the optimal permutation schedule to process the jobs. The primary output of the system is the recommended schedule of the jobs, replete with Gantt chart.},

A modified insert move local search method which can weaken the negative effect generated by greedy is combined with estimation of distribution algorithms to gain a reduction of the makespan, which accelerate the search close to good solution.

abstract={This paper deals with the permutation flow shop scheduling problem with separated and sequence-independent machine setup times. A heuristic method with the objective of minimizing the total time to complete the schedule is introduced. The proposed heuristic is based on a structural property of this scheduling problem, which provides an upper bound on the idle time of the machines between the completion of the setup task and the beginning of job processing. Experimental results show that the new heuristic outperforms two existing ones. Copyright © 2011 by ABCM.},

abstract={A new model which describes the flow shop scheduling problems with zero wait in the batch plant is constructed. A novel adaptive endocrine and immune algorithm (EIA) is first proposed based on the regulation laws of hormone in the endocrine system and the close relationship of mutual modulation between the endocrine system and the immune system. An accelerating mechanism and a restraining mechanism are also integrated into the EIA approach to promote the search for global optimal solutions. The simulation results show the convergence rate and search precision of the EIA are much better than those of the standard immune algorithm and the improved immune algorithm, thus verifying the effectiveness, originality and excellence of EIA.

abstract={In this paper we study the production scheduling problem for a two-stage flow shop in which there are options of outsourcing some operations to subcontractors. The basic objective is to look for a production schedule that can optimally utilize the resources of both the in-house production and outsourcing so that the makespan is minimized. The logistics issue between the subcontractor and the in-house shop further complicates the problem. We present models for different situations of outsourcing. For each model, we develop optimization algorithms and conduct computational experiments to study the managerial insights for the models and the algorithms. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Even though research in flow shop production scheduling has been carried out for many decades, there is still a gap between research and applicationespecially in manufacturing paradigms such as one-of-a-kind production (OKP) that intensely challenges real time adaptive production scheduling and control. Indeed, many of the most popular heuristics continue to use Johnson's algorithm (1954) as their core. This paper presents a state space (SS) heuristic, integrated with a closed-loop feedback control structure, to achieve adaptive production scheduling and control in OKP. Our SS heuristic, because of its simplicity and computational efficiency, has the potential to become a core heuristic. Through a series of case studies, including an industrial implementation in OKP, our SS-based production scheduling and control system demonstrates significant potential to improve production efficiency. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The permutation flow shop scheduling problem is a part of production scheduling, which belongs to the hardest combinatorial optimization problem. A new hybrid algorithm is introduced which we called it HPSO, It combines knowledge evolution algorithm(KEA) and particle swarm optimization(PSO) algorithm for the permutation flow shop scheduling problem. The objective function is to search for a sequence of jobs in order that we can obtain the minimization value of maximum completion time (makespan). By the mechanism of KEA, its global search ability is fully utilized for finding the global solution. By the operating characteristic of PSO, the local search ability is also made full use. The experimental results indicate that the solution quality of the permutation flow shop scheduling problem based on HPSO is better than those based on Genetic algorithm, and than those based on standard PSO. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Machines can be unavailable in most real-life manufacturing systems for many reasons. In this paper, we investigate the problem of integrating production scheduling and preventive maintenance in a flowshop composed of M different machines in series, aiming to minimize the total weighed system cost. We assume that for a multi-machine series manufacturing system, whenever one of the M machines is stopped to perform a preventive maintenance activity, the whole system must be stopped. This assumption leads to an increase of preventive maintenance opportunities for the other machines in the system. Then, an integrated model is presented based on the opportunistic maintenance policy while taking into account the economic dependence of different machines. The model aims to search for an optimal combination of production and preventive maintenance planning. To facilitate the construction of the model, a judgment factor and a reason factor are introduced to describe the working state of the system and to explain the reasons for system downtime. The numerical example optimized with Genetic Algorithm on Matlab indicates that this integrated model can reduce the total weighted system cost by nearly 11.72%. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={This article addresses the problem of hybrid flexible flow line where some constraints are considered to alleviate the chasm between the real-world industries scheduling and the production scheduling theories. Sequence-dependent setup times, machine release date and time lags are three constraints deemed to project the circumstances commonly found in real-world industries. To tackle the complexity of the problem at hand, we propose an approach base on genetic algorithm (GA). However, the performance of most evolutionary algorithms is significantly impressed by the values determined for the miscellaneous parameters which these algorithms possess. Hence, response surface methodology is applied to set the parameters of GA and to estimate the proper values of GA parameters in continually intervals. Finally, problems of various sizes are utilized to test the performance of the proposed algorithm and to compare it with some existing heuristic in the literature such as SPT, LPT and NEH. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The flow shop scheduling problem is a branch of production scheduling, which is among the hardest combinatorial optimization problem, and represents an important area in production scheduling. In this paper, a new effective hybrid algorithm is proposed which is based on plant growth simulation algorithm for permutation flow shop scheduling with the criterion to minimize the maximum completion time (makespan). In the algorithm, a directed graph which is based on the characteristic of flow shop scheduling problem representation is developed, and an efficient exchangeable node set is proposed and incorporated into plant growth simulation algorithm. Simulation results based on well-known benchmarks and comparisons with standard genetic algorithm demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bionic algorithm. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Research on production scheduling under uncertainty has recently received much attention. This paper presents a novel decomposition-based approach (DBA) to flexible flow shop (FFS) scheduling under stochastic setup times. In comparison with traditional methods using a single approach, the proposed DBA combines and takes advantage of two different approaches, namely the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the Shortest Processing Time Algorithm (SPT), to deal with uncertainty. A neighbouring K-means clustering algorithm is developed to firstly decompose an FFS into an appropriate number of machine clusters. A back propagation network (BPN) is then adopted to assign either GA or SPT to generate a sub-schedule for each machine cluster. Finally, an overall schedule is generated by integrating the sub-schedules of the machine clusters. Computation results reveal that the DBA is superior to SPT and GA alone for FFS scheduling under stochastic setup times. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper addresses the production scheduling problem in a multi-page invoice printing system. The system comprises three stages: the stencil preparation stage, the page printing stage and the invoice assembly stage. Since each page can be considered as a component and the invoice as the finished product, the production system for multi-page invoices can be treated as an assembly-type flowshop with parallel machines at the last two stages. Moreover, two types of sequence-dependent setup operations are considered at the second stage. The objective is to minimize the makespan for all the invoice orders. We first formulate this problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Then a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is proposed for solving it due to its NP-hardness. To evaluate the performance of the HGA heuristic, a lower bound for the makespan is developed. Numerical experiment indicates that our algorithm can solve the problem efficiently and effectively. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose: In order to achieve excellence in manufacturing, goals like lean, economic and quality production with enhanced productivity play a crucial role in this competitive environment. It also necessitates major improvements in generally three primary technical areas: variation reduction, equipment reliability, and production scheduling. Complexity of the real world scheduling problems also increases with interactive multiple decision-making criteria. This paper aims to deal with multi-objective flow shop scheduling problems, including sequence dependent set up time (SDST). The paper also aims to consider the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of total weighted tardiness, total weighted earliness and makespan simultaneously. It proposes a new heuristic-based hybrid simulated annealing (HSA) for near optimal solutions in a reasonable time. Design/methodology/approach: Six modified NEH's based HSA algorithms are proposed for efficient scheduling of jobs in a multi-objective SDST flow shop. Problems of up to 200 jobs and 20 machines are tested by the proposed HSA and a defined relative percentage improvement index is used for analysis and comparison of different MNEH's based hybrid simulated annealing algorithms. Findings: From the results, it has been derived that performance of SA_EWDD (NEH) up to ten machines' problems, and SA_EPWDD (NEH) up to 20 machines' problems, were better over others especially for large sized SDST flow shop scheduling problems for the considered multi-objective fitness function. Originality/value: HSA and multi-objective decision making proposed in the present work is a modified approach in the area of SDST flow shop scheduling. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Real manufacturing is dynamic and tends to suffer a lot of uncertainties. Research on production scheduling under uncertainty has recently received much attention. Although various approaches have been developed for scheduling under uncertainty, this problem is still difficult to tackle by any single approach, because of its inherent difficulties. This chapter describes a decomposition-based approach (DBA) for makespan minimisation of a flexible flow shop (FFS) scheduling problem with stochastic processing times. The DBA decomposes an FFS into several machine clusters which can be solved more easily by different approaches. A neighbouring K-means clustering algorithm is developed to firstly group the machines of an FFS into an appropriate number of machine clusters, based on a weighted cluster validity index. A back propagation network (BPN) is then adopted to assign either the Shortest Processing Time (SPT) Algorithm or the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to generate a sub-schedule for each machine cluster. After machine grouping and approach assignment, an overall schedule is generated by integrating the sub-schedules of the machine clusters. Computation results reveal that the DBA is superior to SPT and GA alone for FFS scheduling under stochastic processing times, and that it can be easily adapted to schedule FFS under other uncertainties. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

By analyzing the disadvantages of AFSA, this paper presents an improved artificial fish swarm algorithm(IAFSA). IAFSA adopts the order method based on exchanging list during the action of preying, and adopts an adaptive moving of small scale during the action of random move. According to the mathematic model of permutation flow shop scheduling, this paper provides the IAFSA-based solving strategy for the scheduling problem and discusses in detail the solving steps. The experiment results show that IAFSA has a stronger ability of global search and a better search efficiency, and it is feasible and valid.},

abstract={In this paper, a new solution approach is proposed for production scheduling problem with compressible processing times. The model determines both lot sizing and lot streaming of multiple products in a flow shop production environment over a finite number of planning periods. Compressibility of the process time in a predefined time interval leads to nonlinearity of the model which is more complicated than fixed process times. Furthermore, due to the undesirability of idle times for production managers, the algorithm takes it into account for obtaining more efficient production schedules. The heuristic method consists of two main phases that calls them sequentially to find a good quality solution with a reasonable worst-case time complexity. Experimental results on test data and random test problems confirms the capability of the proposed approach in dealing with a variety set of real cases such that it works better than most of related previous studies.},

abstract={Flexible flow-line manufacturing is being adopted by the manufacturers to produce an increased number of variations or models of an end product in order to meet customers' preferences and demand. This paper addresses a sequence dependent flexible flow-line assembly, which is commonly witnessed in the manufacturing of automobile, computer, home-appliances, etc. A model that integrates procurement and production scheduling is developed with the objective of minimising Integrated Total Cost (ITC), which includes assembly, switchover, material, inventory and shortage costs. A new sequencing heuristic algorithm for the above model is proposed by modifying the singleperiod flow-shop sequencing heuristic. The performance of proposed sequencing heuristic algorithm in the flexible flow-line assembly involving multi periods is analysed using the base sequences generated with four popular single-period sequencing heuristic algorithms.

abstract={This paper aims to investigate the improvements in manufacturing efficiency. This can be realized by broadening the scope of the production scheduling which includes both the sequencing jobs and processing-time control through the deployment of the flexible resource. This study assumes an environment in which a set of jobs must be scheduled in a flow shop, where each manufacturing cell consists of a single machine. There the processing time of each operation depends on the amount of resource allocated to the machine. This study is expected to solve the static version of flow-shop flexible-resource scheduling (SFSFR) problem with genetic algorithm to minimize the weight sum of earliness and tardiness. We suggest a master-slave genetic algorithm (MSGA) that can solve the resource allocation and job sequencing together in order to avoid the defect of two-stage method, and the heuristic algorithm of shifting job completed before due date by insertion of idle time is embedded into genetic algorithm to optimize the solutions. At last, the adaptive genetic operator is applied to increase convergence rate and improve search capability. Experimental results show that the proposed master-slave genetic algorithm performed better than other related algorithms. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Since real manufacturing is dynamic and tends to suffer a wide range of uncertainties, research on production scheduling under uncertainty has received much more attention recently. Although various approaches have been developed for scheduling under uncertainty, this problem is still difficult to tackle by any single approach, because of its inherent difficulties. This paper considers makespan minimisation of a flexible flow shop (FFS) scheduling problem with stochastic processing times. It proposes a novel decomposition-based approach (DBA) to decompose an FFS into several machine clusters which can be solved more easily by different approaches. A neighbouring K-means clustering algorithm is developed to firstly group the machines of an FFS into an appropriate number of machine clusters, based on a weighted cluster validity index. A back propagation network (BPN) is then adopted to assign either the shortest processing time (SPT) or the genetic algorithm (GA) to generate a sub-schedule for each machine cluster. If two neighbouring machine clusters are allocated with the same approach, they are subsequently merged. After machine grouping and approach assignment, an overall schedule is generated by integrating the sub-schedules of the clusters. Computation results reveal that the proposed approach is superior to SPT and GA alone for FFS scheduling under stochastic processing times.},

abstract={Production planning and scheduling problems emphasize the need for the availability of management tools that can help to assure proper service levels to customers, maintaining, at the same time, the production costs at acceptable levels and maximizing the utilization of the production facilities. In this case, a production scheduling problem that arises in the context of the activities of a company dedicated to the manufacturing of furniture for children and teenagers is addressed. Two bicriteria metaheuristic procedures are proposed to solve the sequencing problem in a production equipment that constitutes the bottleneck of the production process of the company. The production scheduling problem can be characterized as a general flow shop with sequence dependant setup times and additional inventory constraints. Two objectives are simultaneously taken into account when the quality of the candidate solutions is evaluated: the minimization of completion time of all jobs, or makespan, and the minimization of the total flow time of all jobs. Both procedures are based on a local search strategy that responds to the structure of the simulated annealing metaheuristic. In this case, both metaheuristic approaches generate a set of solutions that provides an approximation to the optimal Pareto front. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed techniques a series of experiments was conducted. After analyzing the results, it can be said that the solutions provided by both approaches are adequate from the viewpoint of the quality as well as the computational effort involved in their generation. Nevertheless, a further refinement of the proposed procedures should be implemented with the aim of facilitating a quasi-automatic definition of the solution parameters. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={Flow shop production lines have been practiced for many years inmanufacturing systems. Makespan is the total completion time of all theactivities and is known as one of the most criteria in manufacturing systems.Minimizing this criteria causes more efficiently use of the resources speciallymachinery and manpower. By assigning some budget to some of the operations theoperation time of these activities will be reduced and will affect the totalcompletion time of all the operations (which is called makespan). In this paperthis issue is practiced in hybrid flow shops. At first we convert hybrid flowshop to a network model and by using a linear programming approach it isidentified in order to minimize makespan ( the total completion time of thenetwork) which activities are better to absorb the predetermined and limitedbudget. Minimizing the total completion time ofall the activities in the networkis equivalent to minimizing makespan in production scheduling. The problem issolved by lindo and the result helps the decision maker to assign the budget tothe desired operations. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={One-of-a-kind production (OKP) is a competitive production mode aiming at achieving mass customization. Whereas, dynamics in OKP cause difficulties on production scheduling, which may be manifested as frequent changes of customer orders, differences of production processes, different processing times of products, and so on. For production scheduling in OKP, we propose a state-space (SS) heuristic. Based on case studies on Taillard's benchmarks, SS shows improvement over the best of six heuristics, CDS. SS also shows the suitability especially for adaptive production control to deal with disturbances, such as operator absence/machine breakdown.},

abstract={In this paper, a Hybrid Genetic-Immune algorithm (HGIA) is developed to solve the flow-shop scheduling problems. The regular genetic algorithm is applied in the first-stage to rapidly evolve and when the processes are converged up to a pre-defined iteration then the Artificial Immune System (AIS) is introduced to hybridize Genetic Algorithm (GA) in the second stage. Therefore, HGIA continues to search optimal solution via co-evolutional process. In the co-evolutionary process, GA and AIS cooperate with each other to search optimal solution by searching different objective functions. One is named fitness in GA section and another one is named antigen which will evoke the withstanding of antibodies. In the process of fighting, the antibodies will evolve till they can resist the antigen. An improved survival strategy of lifespan is also proposed to extend the lifespan of the antibodies as a result the selected antibodies will stay in system longer. The hybrid of GA and AIS can simultaneously contain two objectives. Hence, larger searching space and escaping from local optimal solution will be the superiority for hybridizing GA and AIS. In the research, a set of flow-shop scheduling problems are applied for validating the efficiency. The intensive experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach for Flow-shop problems in Production Scheduling. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={The problem of scheduling a three-machine production, where machines suffer random breakdowns, is addressed with respect to the makespan objective. For our problem, obtaining an optimal schedule by implicit enumeration techniques (after dominance relations are established) is very hard, mainly due to the total idle time on machine 3. That is because it is the maximum of n terms, each of which includes the difference of two random sums of random variables, and furthermore, the terms are dependent. A dominance relation for stochastically minimizing makespan is established in the flowshop where machines suffer random breakdowns and processing times of the jobs conform to the conditions. Furthermore, it is shown that algorithm for the deterministic problem stochastically minimizes makespan when random breakdowns are present. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={A semi-flow-shop scheduling problem, similar to flow-shop, was presented herein. The jobs which were processed as batches on identical production line may pass certain working procedure, and go into the next directly, according to the respective technological requirements. This scheduling problem was known from the flow-shop scheduling problem. According to the actual requirements of production scheduling, the objectives considered the earliness and tardiness, as well as the idle of machine tools. An improved genetic algorithm was proposed to solve this scheduling problem. The concept of gene entropy was used for the calculation of sharing function, adaptive probabilities of crossover and mutation. These measures improve the performance of the algorithm.},

abstract={There is a great deal of external fluctuation such as order change or delayed delivery of materials, and uncertain components such as machine trouble or process delay in the real shop floor. It is difficult to execute real production according to the schedule which is established in advance. Therefore, a new production scheduling technique which can consider both external fluctuation and uncertain component existing in the real shop floor is required. In this paper, a real-virtual interaction method for production scheduling is proposed, which can adaptively and effectively consider both dynamic external fluctuation and uncertain component by using model plant in the real system and computer simulation in the virtual system to interact with each other. The effectiveness of real-virtual interaction method is verified by experiments on flow shop problem. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={With the increase in manufacturing complexity, conventional production scheduling techniques for generating a reasonable manufacturing schedule have become ineffective. Therefore, applying efficient algorithm to solve the scheduling problems is essential for reducing the time budget. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) is very effective in solving discrete combinatorial problems but they are frequently faced with a problem of early convergence. During the evolutionary processes, GAs are often trapped in a local optimum. In the literature, plenty of work has been investigated to introduce new methods for overcoming this essential problem of genetic algorithms. In this paper, a two-phase Genetic-Immune algorithm is developed to solve the flow-shop scheduling problems. The regular genetic algorithm is applied in the first-phase and when the processes are converged up to a pre-defined iteration then the Artificial Immune System (AIS) is introduced in the second phase. After the two-phase evolution process, the Genetic Immune Algorithm (GIA) is applied to deal with different objective functions named antigen which will evoke the withstanding of antibodies. In the process of fighting, the antibodies will evolve till they can resist the antigen. An improved survival strategy of lifespan is proposed to extend the lifespan of the antibody so that can keep selected antibodies stay in system longer. Finally, the Two-phase Genetic-Immune Algorithm (TPGIA) is tested on a set of flow-shop scheduling problems.The intensive experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach when compared with other methods.},

abstract={The phenomenon of the learning effect has been extensively studied in many different areas of operational research. However, there have been a few studies in the general context of production scheduling; also there have been fewer studies in flow-shop. Until the beginning of 1990 Earliness/Tardiness (E/T) problem was known as weighted absolute deviation problem. Not only tardiness but also earliness is very important performance criteria for scheduling problem. While total tardiness criteria provides adaptation for due date (ignoring results of earliness done jobs), it deals with only cost of tardiness. However this phenomenon has been started to change with Just in Time (JIT) production concept. Earliness is as important as tardiness on JIT production. In this study, the integer programming was suggested to take in to consideration "weighted E/T performance criteria and learning effect process property at the two machine flow-shop scheduling" and solution results was evaluated with sample problems by us.},

abstract={This paper proposes a hybrid metaheuristic for the minimization of makespan in permutation flow shop scheduling problems. The solution approach is robust, fast, and simply structured, and comprises three components: an initial population generation method based on a greedy randomized constructive heuristic, a genetic algorithm (GA) for solution evolution, and a variable neighbourhood search (VNS) to improve the population. The hybridization of a GA with VNS, combining the advantages of these two individual components, is the key innovative aspect of the approach. Computational experiments on benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid metaheuristic reaches high-quality solutions in short computational times. Furthermore, it requires very few user-defined parameters, rendering it applicable to real-life flow shop scheduling problems. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Most production scheduling-related research assumes that a job visits certain machines once at most, but this is often untrue in practical situations. A reentrant permutation flow-shop (RPFS) describes situations in which a job must be processed on machines in M1, M2, ⋯, Mm, M1, M2, ⋯, Mm, ⋯, and M1, M2, ⋯, Mm order and no job is allowed to pass a previous job. This study minimizes makespan by using the genetic algorithm to move from local optimal solutions to near-optimal solutions for RPFS scheduling problems. In addition, the hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) improves the genetic algorithm's performance in solving RPFS. © INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING.},

abstract={Recently, production scheduling becomes increasingly important in order to satisfy diversifying needs of consumers and reduce unnecessary costs because of the intensified competition between enterprises. As production system becames large-scale and complex, it is difficult to manage systems intensively. So autonomous distributed scheduling is required. In conventional researches, auction based scheduling, that is one of the autonomous distributed scheduling, has been proposed and recognised that it allows quick decision-making and can respond dynamic environmental variation flexibly, but has a defect that the optimality is not ensured. On the other hand, recently combinatorial auction method attracts attention. Combinatorial auction, that is an auction where bidders can bid on combinations of items, can effectively allocate multiple items. In this study, we propose an optimization method based on combinatorial auction for production scheduling problems. Due to using combinatorial auction, we can expect to realise a scheduling approach considering both autonomous distributed property and optimality at the same time. We formulate two combinatorial auction models such as model 1 and model 2. Machines bid for combination of jobs in the model 1, and jobs bid for combination of machine's timeslots in the model 2. We analyse the characteristics of the proposed method with simple scheduling problems as a basic study in this paper.},

abstract={This paper addresses a particular problem where the buyer-supplier relationship is very strong but the manufacturer's order to its supplier is unclear or uncertain. In this situation, the supplier plans its production according to the end-producer's production plan, which could be changed any time based on sales. The supplier is able to access the end-producer's production plan and real-Time sale data so that when the end-producer's production plan is changed, the supplier responds to the changing plan. Sharing this type of information could assist the supplier to estimate or predict the changing probability of the end-producer's order. Production scheduling of the supplier could be an alternative approach to mitigate the problem. Five scheduling methods based on the processing time and the changing probability of each order are proposed to solve the problem with three objective functions: The mean of the makespan, the maximum of the makespan, and the standard deviation of the makespan. The simulation-based analysis approach is applied as a tool to investigate the relative performances of all proposed scheduling methods. The analysis shows that the scheduling method, which is a combination of schedules based on orderchanging probability and the minimization of the makespan in a deterministic flow shop scheduling problems, provides the best performance compared to the others in all objective functions and in various scheduling environments.

abstract={The flow shop scheduling with the no-wait constraint is a typical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem and represents an important area in production scheduling. In this paper, a class of particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach with simulated annealing (SA) and hypothesis test (HT), namely PSOSAHT is proposed for the stochastic flow shop scheduling with no-wait constraint to minimize the maximum completion time (makespan). The developed algorithm not only applies evolutionary search guided by the mechanism of PSO, but it also applies the local search guided by the jumping mechanism of SA. Thus, both global exploration and local exploitation are balanced. Meanwhile, it applies HT to perform a statistical comparison to avoid some repeated search to some extent. Simulation results and comparisons demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness and robustness of the proposed hybrid PSO-based algorithm.

abstract={This paper considers the problem of production scheduling in a real-life manufacturing plant belonging to the apparel industry. The problem is modeled as a two-stage flexible flow shop, with minimization of both makespan and number of tardy jobs. For this new scheduling problem, we propose a bi-objective evolutionary algorithm. A set of experiments is performed using real data from the company's database. Experimental results show the relevance of the proposed procedure in terms of performance metrics, as opposed to the current manual scheduling procedure as well as against available commercial schedulers. The procedure was actually implemented as the scheduler procedure at the company. Such results also illustrate the improvement in key performance metrics of the production line.},

abstract={This paper proposes to take the ability difference between parallel machines into account in flexible flow-shop scheduling problems (FFSP), and formulates an integer programming model firstly. A particle coding and decoding method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) for FFSP is proposed, A new particle computation measure to scheduling problems is presented, a hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) with self-adaptive inertia weight and mutation operator is designed. Numerous experiments are undertaken to assess the performance of the new HPSO, computational results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing genetic algorithms, and the convergence curve indicates that the HPSO effectively improves the capacity of basic PSO. ©2008 IEEE.},

abstract={This chapter sets out to present a very important class of production scheduling problems and the main methods employed to solve them. More specifically, after a brief description of single and parallel machines scheduling problems, which constitute the basis of production scheduling research, the main shop scheduling problems are presented (flow shop, job shop, open shop, group shop and mixed shop) followed by an analysis of their computational complexity. Thereafter, the most important exact, heuristic and meta-heuristic methods are presented and classified. Finally, a thorough review for each shop scheduling problem is conducted where the most important methods proposed in the literature, specifically for each problem, are presented. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In this paper a sequential resolution of the joint production and preventive maintenance scheduling problem in permutation flowshops is considered with the objective of minimizing the makespan. The proposed sequential algorithm, called SAS, consists of two steps: First the scheduling of the production jobs with Ant System algorithm (AS) by Dorigo and al. (1996) is considered. Then the insertion of the maintenance tasks is done according to several heuristics developed in previous works, taking the production scheduling as a strong constraint. Computational experiments are conducted on a large set of instances and the resulting joint ACO is presented.},

abstract={This paper describes the implementation and operational results of a cyclical master production-scheduling model, steering the manufacturing process of a photographic film-producing company. The involved company has a number one or two selling position in the medical and graphical film market. In film production all items are produced within two stages. The first stage is process-oriented and produces a limited number of intermediate products. The second stage is flow-shop oriented and cuts and slices the intermediate products into a large number of end products. In its search for a global optimum, the company wanted to synchronise operations by establishing a common replenishment period as a co-ördination mechanism between the first and second production stage. The proposed cyclical model uses a level-by-level approach and solves the economic lot-scheduling problem (ELSP). The cyclical model proved to be very robust when aligning with dynamic demand, allowing a synchronisation of operations. Based on the resulting schedule stability management lowered the levels of safety stock, which resulted in significant savings. This paper compares the cyclical model with the mathematical optimum, generated by solving the corresponding capacitated lot-sizing problem (CLSP). The results prove the ability of the proposed method to achieve a near optimal solution. The cyclical model does not suffer from the NP hardness of the CLSP and is, therefore, able to solve large-scale models. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={It is well known that the flow-shop scheduling problem (FSSP) is a branch of production scheduling and is NP-hard. Now, many different approaches have been applied for permutation flow-shop scheduling to minimize makespan, but current algorithms even for moderate size problems cannot be solved to guarantee optimality. Some literatures searching PSO for continuous optimization problems are reported, but papers searching PSO for discrete scheduling problems are few. In this paper, according to the discrete characteristic of FSSP, a novel particle swarm optimization (NPSO) algorithm is presented and successfully applied to permutation flow-shop scheduling to minimize makespan. Computation experiments of seven representative instances (Taillard) based on practical data were made, and comparing the NPSO with standard GA, we obtain that the NPSO is clearly more efficacious than standard GA for FSSP to minimize makespan. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={This paper addresses a flow-shop scheduling problem with identical parallel machines at each stage (machine center) for minimizing the sum of the earliness and tardiness costs. The criteria are to minimize maintenance and shortage costs. An efficient solution approach for hybrid flow-shop scheduling problem is presented. Three heuristic algorithms are developed and utilized in this approach. The first algorithm allocates jobs to machines and converts the hybrid flow-shop problem in to several flow-shop problems. Then each ordinary flow-shop problem is solved utilizing a second algorithm. The third algorithm performs resource leveling by comparing the remaining utilized resources. If there's no improvement in the solution after several iterations, the stopping condition is reached. Computational experiments in this research determines the optimum utilization of the limited resources (bottlenecks) and their superiority over SA/TS algorithm is shown and establishes a solution method for integer linear programming problems. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Production scheduling has been recognized as common but challenging combinatorial problems. Because of their complexity, recent research has turned to genetic algorithms to address such problems. Although genetic algorithms have been proven to facilitate the entire space search, they lack in fine-tuning capability for obtaining the global optimum. Therefore, in this study a hybrid genetic algorithm was developed for optimization. Scheduling problems often involve more than one criterion and therefore require multicriteria analysis. Therefore a multicriteria flowshop scheduling problem with setup times is considered. The objective function of the problem is minimization of the weighted sum of total completion time, makespan, maximum tardiness and maximum earliness. An integer programming model is developed for the problem which belongs to NP-hard class. According to computational results, the hybrid genetic algorithm proposed is effective in finding problem solutions. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent years, most researchers have focused on methods which mimic natural processes in problem solving. These methods are most commonly termed "nature-inspired" methods. Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a new and encouraging group of these algorithms. The ant system (AS) is the first algorithm of ACO. In this study, an improved ACO method is used to solve hybrid flow shop (HFS) problems. The n-job and k-stage HFS problem is one of the general production scheduling problems. HFS problems are NP-hard when the objective is to minimize the makespan [1]. This research deals with the criterion of makespan minimization for HFS scheduling problems. The operating parameters of AS have an important role on the quality of the solution. In order to achieve better results, a parameter optimization study is conducted in this paper. The improved ACO method is tested with benchmark problems. The test problems are the same as those used by Carlier and Neron (RAIRO-RO 34(1):1-25, 2000), Neron et al. (Omega 29(6):501-511, 2001), and Engin and Döyen (Future Gener Comput Syst 20(6):1083-1095, 2004). At the end of this study, there will be a comparison of the performance of the proposed method presented in this paper and the branch and bound (B&B) method presented by Neron et al. (Omega 29(6):501-511, 2001). The results show that the improved ACO method is an effective and efficient method for solving HFS problems. © 2007 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

abstract={Flow shop sequencing is one of the most well-known production scheduling problems and atypical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with strong engineering background. To efficiently deal with permutation flow shop sequencing problems, a novel algorithm, Artificial Immune Algorithm (AIA) is proposed which is inspired by the immune system of human to simulate the process of the interaction between antigens, antibodies and memory cells. The algorithm is tested on some benchmarks. Experimental results show AIA is quite flexible with satisfactory results and require fewer running time than Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing.© 2007 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

As an application of this property, the original scheduling problem with the makespan criterion can be heuristically solved by an analogy with the asymmetric traveling salesman problem.},

abstract={Previous studies of the precast production scheduling problems seldom consider resource planning problems. In particular, available scheduling models and approaches have not included mould planning. This paper describes a GA based approach for minimizing mould usage in the precast production scheduling problem posed using the Flow Shop Sequencing Model (FSSM). The minimization problem is initially formulated and solved as a single objective optimization problem, and then as a multi-objective optimization problem, by including makespan and tardiness as additional objectives. The normalized weighted Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach is then used to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. Computational results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the approach. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The no-wait flow shop scheduling that requires jobs to be processed without interruption between consecutive machines is a typical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, and represents an important area in production scheduling. This paper proposes an effective hybrid algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) for no-wait flow shop scheduling with the criterion to minimize the maximum completion time (makespan). In the algorithm, a novel encoding scheme based on random key representation is developed, and an efficient population initialization, an effective local search based on the Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) heuristic, as well as a local search based on simulated annealing (SA) with an adaptive meta-Lamarckian learning strategy are proposed and incorporated into PSO. Simulation results based on well-known benchmarks and comparisons with some existing algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid algorithm. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2007.},

abstract={The stochastic flow shop scheduling problem with no-wait constraint, which requires jobs have to be processed without interruption between consecutive machines and with uncertain processing time, is a typical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem and represents an important area in production scheduling. And it is also difficult because of inaccurate objective estimation, huge search space, and multiple local minima. As a novel evolutionary technique, particle swarm optimization (PSO) has attracted much attention and wide applications for both function and combinatorial problems, but there is no research on PSO for stochastic flow shop scheduling with no-wait constraint. In this paper, a class of PSO approach with simulated annealing (SA) and hypothesis test (HT), namely PSOSAHT is proposed for the above problem with respect to the makespan criterion (i.e. minimizing the maximum completion time). Simulation results and comparisons based on well-known benchmarks demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness and robustness of the proposed hybrid algorithm. Meanwhile, the effects of noise magnitude and number of evaluation on searching performances are also investigated.},

abstract={Job-shop scheduling problem(JSSP) is very common in a discrete manufacturing environment. It deals with multi-operation models, which are different from the flow shop models. It is usually very hard to find its optimal solution. In this paper, a new hybrid approach in dealing with this job-shop scheduling problem based on particle swarm optimization(PSO) and simulated annealing (SA) technique is presented. PSO employs a collaborative population-based search, which is inspired by the social behavior of bird flocking. It combines local search(by self experience) and global search(by neighboring experience), possessing high search efficiency. SA employs certain probability to avoid becoming trapped in a local optimum and the search process can be controlled by the cooling schedule. The hybrid algorithm combines the high speed of PSO with the powerful ability to avoid being trapped in local minimum of SA. We compare the hybrid algorithm to both the standard PSO and SA models, computer simulations have shown that the proposed hybrid approach is of high speed and efficiency. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Genetic algorithms (GAs) have gained wide research and applications in production scheduling fields, but the efficiency and effectiveness of a GA significantly depend on its parameters and operators. In contrast to the rich research on determination of optimal and adaptive parameters, little research has been done on determining optimal combination of genetic operators. Different from the traditional way by trial and error, this paper presents a novel and systematical approach based on ordinal optimisation (OO) and optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) technique to determine optimal combination of genetic operators for flow shop scheduling problems. Simulation results show that the proposed methodology is able to determine optimal combination of genetic operators and simultaneously to provide a good solution with reasonable performance evaluation for scheduling problem.},

abstract={We consider the two-machine open shop and two-machine flow shop scheduling problems in which each machine has to be maintained exactly once during the planning period, and the duration of each of these intervals depends on its start time. The objective is to minimize the maximum completion time of all activities to be scheduled. We resolve complexity and approximability issues of these problems. The open shop problem is shown to be polynomially solvable for quite general functions defining the length of the maintenance intervals. By contrast, the flow shop problem is proved binary NP-hard and pseudopolynomially solvable by dynamic programming. We also present a fully polynomial approximation scheme and a fast 3/2-approximation algorithm. © 2006 INFORMS.},

abstract={Production scheduling is an important part in the factories, and there are various uncertainties in the production scheduling of industrial processes in reality. The earliness/tardiness Flow Shop scheduling problems with different due windows are discussed in the paper, which is typical of the finite intermediate storage time of products. The uncertain processing time is dealt with by fuzzy mathematics, and a scheduling model is then established based on the fuzzy programming theory. Furthermore, a fuzzy scheduling algorithm is proposed by analogy with the concept and the principle of biological immune system. Finally, the effectiveness of the fuzzy scheduling model and the high efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by simulation results.},

abstract={We consider the stochastic single-machine problem, when the objective is to minimize the expected total weighted completion time of a set of jobs that are released over time. We assume that the existence and the parameters of each job including its release date, weight, and expected processing times are not known until its release date. The actual processing times are not known until processing is completed. We analyze the performance of the on-line nonpreemptive weighted shortest expected processing time among available jobs (WSEPTA) heuristic. When a scheduling decision needs to be made, this heuristic assigns, among the jobs that have arrived but not yet processed, one with the largest ratio of its weight to its expected processing time. We prove that when the job weights and processing times are bounded and job processing times are mutually independent random variables, WSEPTA is asymptotically optimal for the single-machine problem. This implies that WSEPTA generates a solution whose relative error approaches zero as the number of jobs increases. This result can be extended to the stochastic flow shop and open shop problems, as well as models with stochastic job weights. © 2006 INFORMS.},

abstract={This study deals with problems in the design of a production seat system. Using the production seat booking system, a production department with advance agreement of the production capacity, can achieve the delivery inquiry from individual customers. In recent years, supply chain management (SCM) requires immediate and correct answers of delivery date and reduction of stock. The production seat system, which aims to realize these demands, is thought to be one of the current important production systems. This system, however, is not supposed to draw up the production plan for all types of production processes; therefore, we need to set up a margin to all the possible factors that prevent production activities beforehand. This paper formulates a production-planning model for a production seat system for a two-stage flow shop. Two kinds of variables are set as the policy in the model: one is a variable for the frequency of machine trouble and the other is a variable for the estimated error between the actual processing time and the standard time for the plan. We clarify how much factors such as machine trouble and estimated error influence manufacturing performance. This paper presents a basis for designing a production seat booking system through a series of numerical experiments.},

abstract={The flow-shop scheduling problem (FSSP) is a branch of production scheduling, which is among the hardest combinatorial optimization problems. It is well known that this problem with current algorithms even moderately sized problems cannot be solved to guaranteed optimality. Many different approaches have been applied for permutation flowshop scheduling to minimize makespan, but these methods are not satisfying. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been developing rapidly and has been applied widely since it was introduced, as it is easily understood and realized. This paper through the improvement of the option modes of gBest and pBest of PSO algorithm, a similar particle swarm optimization algorithm (SPSOA) applied for permutation flowshop scheduling to minimize makespan is firstly presented. The comparisons are made with SPSOAs and the standard GAs, in which we obtained that the SPSOAs are more clearly efficacious than standard GAs for FSSP to minimize makespan. Computational experiments show the efficiency of the proposed (SPSOA) solving approaches. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The integer programs have been enhanced by the addition of cutting constraints derived for both the long-term customer order assignment and the short-term machine scheduling.

abstract={The flow-shop scheduling problem with the makespan criterion is an important production scheduling problem. Although this problem has a simple formulation, it is NP-hard. Therefore many heuristic and metaheuristic methods had been proposed to solve this problem. In this paper, a hybrid genetic algorithm is presented for the flow-shop scheduling problem. In our method, a modified version of NEH with random re-start is used to generate the Initial population. Also, a new orthogonal array crossover is devised as the crossover operator of the genetic algorithm. The tabu search is hybridized with the genetic algorithm and acts as the local search method. The proposed algorithm had been tested on two benchmarks. The results are compared with those of other methods that had also been tested on these benchmarks. The comparison shows that our method outperforms other methods on these benchmarks. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

abstract={Flow shop sequencing is one of the most well-known production scheduling problems and a typical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with strong engineering background. To efficiently deal with flow shop sequencing problems, an improved Genetic Algorithm using novel adaptive genetic operators is proposed. Researches are made in aspects such as problem modeling, encoding, decoding, crossover and mutation of Genetic Algorithms and so on. The proposed algorithm has been tested on scheduling problem benchmarks.

abstract={This paper presents an integrated approach to solve a multi-item lot-sizing and scheduling problem in a two-stage flow shop environment. The problem tackled stems from a real world process and the data used are the actual process information. In this production system, all items are produced in two stages. The first stage is process-oriented and produces a limited number of intermediate products. The second stage is flow shop oriented and splits up the intermediate products into a very large number of end products. The objective is to develop an integrated repetitive cyclic master production plan, minimising the total set-up and inventory holding costs of the work-in-process and end products. The problem corresponds with solving the capacitated lot sizing problem in a two-stage, multi-product environment under the additional constraint of repetitive cyclic production schedules. The model will use a level by level approach. A heuristic approach will first establish a common cycle length and production frequencies. Secondly a mixed integer linear program will define the production sequences ensuring a smooth load profile. The proposed solution approach is tested out as the main planning concept within the MPS department of a company producing photographic materials (e.g. X-ray film, graphical film). Agfa, the involved company, has a number one or two selling position in the mentioned product groups. This paper will describe the solution approach, the mathematical model and operational results after one year of practical usage.},

abstract={Purpose - This paper presents a new method of resource optimization through workload balance in designing of multiple cellular manufacturing (MCM) systems for flow-shop environments. The application of a step-by-step structured approach to design MCM cells more efficiently and generate smooth flow shop type with better resource utilization. Design/methodology/approach - An industrial application case with 31 products carried on 12 workstations is presented to explore the step-by-step of designing and analyzing the results of alternative cellular manufacturing and balancing the workload. Findings - MCM designs have become an important approach for batch production in the last decade, and their layout provides a dominant flow structure for the production scheduling. The flow shop nature of MCM adds a simplifying structure to the complexity of planning and scheduling. This method will generate many alternative designs and configurations of MCM in the form of highly flexible manufacturing systems. These alternatives could be better a choice for resource optimization in the industrial application. Originality/value - Together with the associated costs, each proposed solution for the MCM could help to design and build efficient and highly flexible systems. Special emphasis will be devoted to the workload balance of workstations, machines, material-handling equipment and WIP with the utilization of the resources in the production system. This method is practical, experiential and participates. A program using C language will be written to test the proposed algorithm for randomly generated input data.},

abstract={Most of research in production scheduling is concerned with the optimization of a single criterion. However the analysis of the performance of a schedule often involves more than one aspect and therefore requires a multi-objective treatment. In this paper we first present (Section 1) the general context of multi-objective production scheduling, analyze briefly the different possible approaches and define the aim of this study i.e. to design a general method able to approximate the set of all the efficient schedules for a large set of scheduling models. Then we introduce (Section 2) the models we want to treat - one machine, parallel machines and permutation flow shops - and the corresponding notations. The method used - called multi-objective simulated annealing - is described in Section 3. Section 4 is devoted to extensive numerical experiments and their analysis. Conclusions and further directions of research are discussed in the last section. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The stochastic flow shop scheduling with uncertain processing time is a typical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem and represents an important area in production scheduling, which is difficult because of inaccurate objective estimation, huge search space, and multiple local minima. As a novel evolutionary technique, particle swarm optimization (PSO) has gained much attention and wide applications for both function and combinatorial problems, but there is no research on PSO for stochastic scheduling cases. In this paper, a class of PSO approach with simulated annealing (SA) and hypothesis test (HT), namely PSOSAHT is proposed for stochastic flow shop scheduling with uncertain processing time with respect to the makespan criterion (i.e. minimizing the maximum completion time). Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness and robustness of the proposed hybrid algorithm. Meanwhile, the effects of noise magnitude and number of evaluation on searching performances are also investigated. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract={Production scheduling is an important part in the factories, and there are various uncertainties in the production scheduling of industrial processes. A scheduling mathematical model for flow shop problems with uncertain processing time has been established based on fuzzy programming theory. And in this paper, the fuzzy model can be translated into two mathematical models about the characteristic of scheduling problems. Furthermore, a fuzzy immune scheduling algorithm combined with the feature of the Immune Algorithm is proposed, which prevents the possibility of stagnation in the iteration process and achieves fast convergence for global optimization. The effectiveness and efficiency of the fuzzy scheduling model and the proposed algorithm are demonstrated by simulation results. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract={Production scheduling seeks optimal combination of short manufacturing time, stable inventory, balanced human and machine utilization rate, and short average customer waiting time. Since the problem in general has been proven as NP-hard, we focus on suboptimal scheduling solutions for parallel flow shop machines where jobs are queued in a bottleneck stage. A Genetic Algorithm with Sub-indexed Partitioning genes (GASP) is proposed to allow more flexible job assignments to machines. Our fitness function considers tardiness, earliness, and utilization rate related variable costs to reflect real requirements. A premature convergence bounce is added to traditional genetic algorithms to increase permutation diversity. Finally, a production scheduling system for an electronic plant based on GASP is implemented and illustrated through real production data. The proposed GASP has demonstrated the following advantages: (1) the solutions from GASP are better and with smaller deviations than those from heuristic rules and genetic algorithms with identical partitioning genes; (2) the added premature convergence bounce helps obtain better solutions with smaller deviations; and (3) the consideration of variable costs in the fitness function helps achieve better performance indicators. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={This paper describes the development of an intelligent search strategy for solving the three-machine flow-shop scheduling problem. The method involved is based on a heuristic search algorithm SLA* (Search and Learning A*) which was derived and improved from the IDA* (Iterative Deepening A*) algorithm developed by Korf in 1985. In addition to solving the three-machine flow-shop scheduling problem, we have also developed two improvements. The first is related to the calculation of heuristic estimates during the search process for flow-shop scheduling problems, and the second is an improved heuristic function for the calculation of the initial heuristic estimates at the beginning of the search process for three-machine problems. This algorithm will be suitable for many industrial problems especially in production scheduling and logistics.},

abstract={Most production scheduling-related research assumes that a job visits certain machines at most once. A new type of manufacturing system, the reentrant shop, has recently become prominent. The fundamental characteristic of a reentrant shop is that jobs may visit a certain machine more than once. This paper studies the problem of scheduling the reentrant job-shop and reentrant flow-shop with the objectives of minimizing the makespan and mean flow time of jobs. Optimization models are first presented, followed by the heuristic procedures based on active and non-delay schedules. New priority rules to accommodate the reentry feature are proposed. Both the new rules and some selected rules of earlier research are incorporated in the schedule generation algorithms to produce active and non-delay schedules. Simulation studies are conducted to compare the performance of active and non-delay schedules, and that of the priority rules in finding heuristic solutions for the problems. ©International Journal of Industrial Engineering.},

The fuzzy numbers is used to denote the uncertainty of processing time in flow shop scheduling problem, and the multiple objectives' scheduling model is developed for flow shop scheduling problems with fuzzy processing time. The multiple objective is converted into single one by weighted method, and the fuzzy optimal problem then transformed to determinate one by Zimmermann algorithm. An efficient genetic algorithm suitable for solving the problems is proposed.

abstract={Production scheduling is an important part in the factories, and there are various uncertainties in the production scheduling of industrial processes. A scheduling mathematical model for flow shop problems with uncertain processing time with finite intermediate storage has been established based on fuzzy programming theory. Furthermore, a fuzzy immune scheduling algorithm combined with the characteristics of the Immune Algorithm is proposed, which prevents the possibility of stagnation in the iteration process and achieves fast convergence for global optimization. The effectiveness and efficiency of the fuzzy scheduling model and the proposed method are demonstrated by simulation results.},

abstract={In this paper, No-wait Flow shop Production Scheduling within Finite Intermediate Storage (FIS) under uncertainty was considered. Finite intermediate storage module and No-wait policy were analyzed respectively and a mixture Flow shop production scheduling model with both No-wait constraints and Finite intermediate storage was set up based on the theory of fuzzy programming, in which fuzzy processing time was conducted. The Maximum Membership Functions of Mean Value (MMFMV) was applied to convert the fuzzy scheduling model to an accurate optimization problem. An improved Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SA) was proposed to verify and optimize the scheduling model. The results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the improved Simulated Annealing Algorithm.},

abstract={In many practical situations of production scheduling, it is either necessary or recommended to group a large number of jobs into a relatively small number of batches. A decision needs to be made regarding both the batching (i.e., determining the number and the size of the batches) and the sequencing (of batches and of jobs within batches). A setup cost is incurred whenever a batch begins processing on a given machine. This paper focuses on batch scheduling of identical processing-time jobs, and machine- and sequence-independent setup times on an m-machine flow-shop. The objective is to find an allocation to batches and their schedule in order to minimize flow-time. We introduce a surprising and nonintuitive solution for the problem. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={In many large-scale manufacturing systems, the production scheduling relies heavily on heuristic algorithms. This investigation presents a novel genetic algorithm (GA) based scheduling mechanism to solve large-scale flow shop scheduling (FSS) problems. Introducing network structuring and forward calculation methods resulted in the mechanism. This mechanism contains the benefits of networked activities and can include not only a project but also a series of tasks. This mechanism simplifies FSS problems and is applicable in scheduling complicated flow shop processes. In the proposed approach, the mechanism and GA heuristics are developed separately, thus enhancing the performance of FSS by varying parameters or operator's setting within GA's heuristic and enables flexible modification of FSS application through altering scheduling criterion. © International Journal of Industrial Engineering.},

abstract={Artificial immune system (AIS) is an intelligent problem-solving technique that has been used in scheduling problems for about 10 years. AIS are computational systems inspired by theoretical immunology, observed immune functions, principles and mechanisms in order to solve problems. In this research, a computational method based on clonal selection principle and affinity maturation mechanism of the immune response is used. The n-job, k-stage hybrid flow shop problem is one of the general production scheduling problems. Hybrid flow shop (HFS) problems are NP-Hard when the objective is to minimize the makespan [Two-stage hybrid flowshop scheduling problem, Oper. Res. Soc. 39 (1988) 359]. The research deals with the criterion of makespan minimization for the HFS scheduling problems. The operating parameters of meta-heuristics have an important role on the quality of the solution. In this paper we present a generic systematic procedure which is based on a multi-step experimental design approach for determining the optimum system parameters of AIS. AIS algorithm is tested with benchmark problems. Experimental results show that the artificial immune system algorithm is an effective and efficient method for solving HFS problems. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Production scheduling is one of the most important problems to be considered in the effective performance of the automatic manufacturing system. It is the typical kind of NP-complete problem. The methods commonly used are not suitable to solve complicated problems because the calculating time rises exponentially with the increase of the problem size. A algorithm-immune based scheduling algorithm (IBSA) is proposed. After the description of the mathematics model and the calculating procedure of immune based scheduling, some examples are tested in the software system called HM_IM and C that is developed using VC++6.0. The testing results show that IBSA has high efficiency to solve scheduling problem.},

abstract={The article presents a comparative study on the strategies of scheduling unites maintenance/production in the workshops of the type flow shop of permutation. Two strategies are presented: the sequential strategy which resolution is done in two stages: initially we schedule the tasks of production then integrate the tasks of maintenance, taking the scheduling of the production as a strong constraint. The integrated strategy is the representation of the tasks of maintenance and production. The objective is to optimize an objective function which takes into account the criteria of maintenance and production at the same time. The Genetic Algorithms (AGs) proved their effectiveness in the scheduling of the production. A comparison among different heuristics implemented will conclude this work. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

abstract={Production scheduling is normally used as a short term planning activity aimed at the minimization of setup costs and makespan. In this article we propose a lot sizing and scheduling methodology for a flow shop production system with the following features: sequence dependent setup costs, limited and non renewable resources and due dates. The proposed procedure, based on genetic algorithms, allows to obtain an integrated solution to the lot-sizing and scheduling problems. Scheduling problems on flow shop production systems are usually decomposed in two sub problems: lot-sizing and sequencing. Nevertheless, the literature reports a number of heuristic techniques which attempts to solve simultaneously the two problems. However, most of the approaches mentioned are based on quite restrictive assumption, which cannot be applied in the case studied in this paper. The production system analyzed here is modeled as a single machine, with resources which become available dynamically over time. Setup costs are sequence dependent and production is required to respect the assigned due dates. We propose a new stochastic algorithm to generate the initial population of the GA, which starts from TSP solutions and obtains feasible solutions for our statements. The GA is tested over different complex level instances and results are benchmarked with the ones provided by an Optimization Language like LINGO. The improvement of our GA is shown in the majority of the cases analyzed.},

abstract={In the production scheduling of industrial processes, there are various uncertainties, and the uncertainty of processing time is the most typical one. In this paper, the uncertainty of processing time has been described as triangle fuzzy numbers, and the scheduling model for flow-shop process under uncertainty has been established based on fuzzy programming theory. The fuzzy programming has been converted to distinct single-objective programming by employing two fuzzy operations given by [7] and the "Middle Maximal Membership" algorithm presented by [8]. The experimental study has validated the efficiency of the proposed scheduling model and fuzzy optimization method, and the influence of the decision factor F has been discussed.},

abstract={Flow shop scheduling is one of the most well-known production scheduling problems and a typical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with strong engineering background. This paper presents an order-based genetic algorithm for flow shop scheduling, which borrows the idea of ordinal optimization to reduce computation and ensure the quality of the solution found and enforces the evolutionary searching mechanism and learning capability of genetic algorithm. With the guidance of ordinal comparison and by emphasizing the order-based search and elitist-based evolution in the proposed approach, good enough solution can be guaranteed with high confidence level and reduced computation quantity, which is demonstrated by numerical simulation based on some benchmarks. Moreover, some parameter sensitivities are presented and discussed.},

abstract={This study treats the selection and application of performance measures and rules for production scheduling (PS). Twenty performance measures and fourteen rules are considered. The experimental factors include shop patterns, scheduling rules, number of machines, job orders arrival, number of jobs, number of operations, processing time, due date, earliness cost, and tardiness cost. The simulation results indicated that, for multi-criteria performance measures, the best three conflicting measures are minimizing the modified mean flow time, minimizing the cost ratio of tardiness and earliness, and minimizing the slack capacity of the machines. Also, the obtained results showed that, the shortest processing time rule is preferred when the performance measures are related to flow time, work in process, or shop utilization. For the due date related performance measures, modified due-date rule is better than the other rules. Finally, the modified slack rule is the best rule for the cost related performance measures.},

abstract={The recent intense dynamic of the global marketplace, characterized with fast pace and novelty of changes, has forced textile producers to adopt new strategies and apply developed techniques to improve their products. The market is no longer satisfied with mass produced unified products. Small lots, diversification of products and short lead-time deliveries are the recent trends in textile manufacturing. In this work the features of textile industry are outlined. A model is developed for optimum production schedules of direct warping system (DWS) and sectional warping system (SWS) for the weaving preparation stage - the most critical operation in any fabric production. Based on the developed model, a computer software is developed to generate production schedules. The model was tested in a major textile company in Alexandria, where good results were achieved.},

abstract={This paper first formulates the hybrid flow shop scheduling (HFSS) problem using an integer programming model and then develops a genetic descent algorithm (GDA) for it. The proposed GDA is constructed by combining the optimal job-machine allocation rules with the appropriate genetic coding. This method can not only generate feasible initial solutions, but also guarantee the feasibility of solutions after genetic operations. In the meantime, neighborhood search is imbedded in the iteration process of the algorithm. In order to testify the effectiveness of GDA, simulation is done based on randomly generated 230 instances. Computational experiments show that: 1) for small size HFSS scheduling problems, the average deviation of GDA from the optimal solution is 0.01%; 2) for medium-large size problems, the performance of GDA is 10.45% better than that of NEH algorithm.},

abstract={There are two alternatives for production organization in precast factories - namely, the comprehensive method and the specialized method. Production scheduling under the specialized alternative has been found to be a difficult optimization problem if heterogeneous elements are involved. A flow shop sequencing model that incorporates actual constraints encountered in practice is proposed for this difficult case of precast production scheduling. The model is solved using a genetic algorithm (GA). The traditional minimize makespan and the more practical minimize tardiness penalty objective functions are optimized separately, as well as simultaneously using a normalized weighted GA. Comparisons between the GA and classical heuristic rules show that the GA can obtain good schedules for the model, giving a family of solutions that are at least as good as those produced by the use of heuristic rules. © ASCE,.},

abstract={This paper addresses the flow shop sequencing problem. Following an investigation of the problem characteristics, a property of this scheduling problem is presented, and is used for the development of a new constructive heuristic with the objective of minimizing the total time to complete the schedule (makespan). The new method, denoted by N&M, is compared with the best constructive heuristic reported in the literature, named NEH. Results from computational experience have shown that for problems having up to 10 machines and 100 jobs, the new heuristic outperforms, on average, the NEH heuristic. There is no significant difference regarding computation effort for both NEH and N&M heuristics.},

Multi-criteria flowshop scheduling is addressed next. Multi-criteria job shop scheduling is subsequently examined. Lastly the multi-criteria open shop problem is solved.

abstract={In this paper, we study a problem of scheduling and batching on two machines in a flow-shop and open-shop environment. Each machine processes operations in batches, and the processing time of a batch is the sum of the processing times of the operations in that batch. A setup time, which depends only on the machine, is required before a batch is processed on a machine, and all jobs in a batch remain at the machine until the entire batch is processed. The aim is to make batching and sequencing decisions, which specify a partition of the jobs into batches on each machine, and a processing order of the batches on each machine, respectively, so that the makespan is minimized. The flow-shop problem is shown to be strongly NP-hard. We demonstrate that there is an optimal solution with the same batches on the two machines; we refer to these as consistent batches. A heuristic is developed that selects the best schedule among several with one, two, or three consistent batches, and is shown to have a worst-case performance ratio of 4/3. For the open-shop, we show that the problem is NP-hard in the ordinary sense. By proving the existence of an optimal solution with one, two or three consistent batches, a close relationship is established with the problem of scheduling two or three identical parallel machines to minimize the makespan. This allows a pseudo-polynomial algorithm to be derived, and various heuristic methods to be suggested.},

abstract={There are two alternatives for production organisation in precast factories, namely the comprehensive method and the specialised method. Production scheduling under the specialised alternative has been found to be a difficult optimisation problem if heterogeneous elements are involved. A flow shop sequencing model is developed for this kind of production scheduling that considers the constraints encountered in actual practice. The model is optimised using a genetic algorithm (GA) approach. The results are compared with those obtained using classical heuristic rules in two examples that involve the objective of minimising the makespan or the total tardiness penalty. The comparison shows that the GA can obtain good schedules for the model, giving a family of solutions that are at least as good as those produced by the heuristic rules. © 2001 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={A flow shop sequencing model (FSSM) that incorporates actual constraints encountered in practice is proposed for the difficult case of specialized precast production scheduling. The model is solved using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The traditional minimize makespan and the more practical minimize tardiness penalty objective functions are optimized separately, as well as simultaneously using a weighted approach. Experiments are conducted to investigate the effect of increasing population size and seeding the initial population with heuristic solutions. Comparisons between the GA and classical heuristic rules show that the GA is competitive, if not better than heuristic rules in discovering a set of good solutions.},

abstract={This paper presents a Lagrangian relaxation-based approach for production scheduling of flexible flow shops (PSFFS) where sequence-dependent setup effects (time and cost) are significant. The approach exploits the idea that scheduling the production of individual parts without considering machine setup effects and scheduling the use of a machine to process a given set of parts are both simpler than PSFFS with setup effects. Since the setup of each machine must match its processing of parts, in a feasible solution of PSFFS, the part production and machine usage schedules must be synchronized. PSFFS is first formulated as a separable integer programming problem with synchronization constraints between part production and machine usage scheduling variables. Lagrangian relaxation is then applied to synchronization constraints, and the scheduling problem is decomposed into two classes of subproblems: part production and machine scheduling subproblems. In these subproblems, there are network flow structures in the equality constraints describing machine status change and production flow balance. Our iterative solution algorithm applies a minimum cost network flow algorithm to solving individual subproblems and adopts an efficient surrogate subgradient method of Luh et al. (1997) to optimize Lagrangian multipliers. A machine availability-searching heuristic finally adjusts the solution to satisfy all synchronization constraints by exploiting the network structure, economic interpretation of Lagrangian multipliers, and the slack time policy. Numerical results of 16 cases, each having 20 test problems, demonstrate that differences between the schedules obtained by our approach and the true optima are on average within 15%. CPU times spent are all less than 17 min on a Pentium-II personal computer. Among the problem dimension factors, the number of part types has the most significant effect on both optimality and computation efficiency. Application of the methodology to daily scheduling of a realistic integrated circuit testing facility of 30 machines takes about 6 min of CPU time to generate a near-optimal solution.},

abstract={Production optimization is considered for stochastic single-part M-machine flow shops over the class of so-called decentralized hedging production policies. A decomposition methodology previously developed for tandem two-machine systems is generalized to M-machine flow shops. Using a machines decoupling approximation and a so-called demand averaging principle, the considered M-machine flow shop is decomposed into a set of M decoupled single machine systems with known analytical production costs. The overall production cost obtained by adding individual costs is parameterized by M critical levels of parts to be determined. Subsequently, the best decentralized hedging production policy is found by minimizing the overall analytical cost over the hedging levels space. The predicted performance of the proposed class of decentralized policies is tested and validated on a number of three-machine flow shops with the help of Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Diverse results obtained indicate that the new hierarchical optimization scheme proposed runs very quickly, has a good performance, and appears to be very competitive for production scheduling in unreliable tandem manufacturing systems.},

abstract={In the flow shop weighted completion time problem, a set of jobs has to be processed on m machines. Every machine has to process each one of the jobs, and every job has the same routing through the machines. The objective is to determine a sequence of the jobs on the machines so as to minimize the sum of the weighted completion times of all jobs on the final machine. In this paper, we present a characterization of the asymptotic optimal solution value for general distributions of the job processing times and weights. In particular, we show that the optimal objective value of this problem is asymptotically equivalent to certain single and parallel machine scheduling problems. This characterization leads to a better understanding of the effectiveness of the celebrated weighted shortest processing time algorithm, as well as to the development of an effective algorithm closely related to the profile fitting heuristic, which was previously utilized for flow shop makespan problems. Computational results show the effectiveness of WSPT and this modified profile fitting heuristic on a set of random test problems. © 1998 INFORMS.},

abstract={This paper addresses production scheduling in a home-use sewing machine company with a centre-satellite factory system. The scheduling problem in this flowshop type involves sequence-dependent setup time, make-to-order policy, onepiece flow processing, and a just-in-time environment, with all orders being delivered exactly on their assigned due-dates. The objective is to find a job sequence that minimizes the inventory level subject to the due-date constraint. A heuristic is proposed to find the near-optimal schedule for the problem.

abstract={This paper presents an optimization model-based approach or production scheduling of flexible flow shops where sequence-dependent setup effect is significant. The scheduling problem is formulated as an integer programming problem. In the presence of setup effect, individual machine setup status must be scheduled in accordance with part processing schedule. A Lagrangian relaxation method is adopted to solve the problem in dual space, where the synchronization constraint between machine setup and part processing is relaxed. An efficient heuristic is developed to adjust the dual solution to primal feasibility. Network flow structures of both machine status change and part flow balance equations are exploited for algorithm development. Numerical results demonstrate that our methodology generates an optimal schedule on a small example and a near-optimal solution on a multi-stage and multi-machine example using a reasonable amount of CPU time.},

abstract={In 1991, IBM San Jose decided to produce and sell magnetic heads for computer disk drives on the open market to original equipment manufacturers. However, as IBM's wafer fabrication facility increased the number of products it manufactured, its manufacturing cycle time lengthened. Since cycle time is important in competing in the open market, IBM San Jose formed a study team (in cooperation with UCLA) to examine the wafer fab and to develop ways to reduce cycle time. The team designed a new production control system and proposed new performance measures for operators and engineers. IBM implemented the new production control system and established the performance measures in June 1992, and the cycle time decreased by 50 percent by the end of 1992.},

abstract={This paper deals with the problem of production scheduling in a two-stage hybrid flow shop, which consists of one machine in the first stage, and multiple process lines in the second stage. In the first stage, materials are batch-processed, which are then fed into one of several process lines in the second stage, depending on the final product specifications. First, we formulated the total flow time or makespan, the capacity utilization and the maximum work-in-process level as measures of manufacturing performance. We analysed, through a series of numerical experiments, how these performance measures are affected by lot sizing, sequencing rules and the scheduling scenario. The following points were clarified. (1) The ratio rule yields the best performance with regard to the makespan, but the LPT rule yields the best performance with regard to the maximum work-in-process level, (2) The optimum lot size is also affected by such operation conditions as the unit processing time, the setup time, and the ratio of unit processing times in the two stages.

abstract={Synchronous production is a philosophy that suggests that the right part should arrive at the right machine at the right time to minimize the inventory and operating costs. To achieve this goal a synchronous material flow is required. However, this is not an easy task in the discrete manufacturing environment because it requires management commitment and algorithmic development. This paper proposes a time window capacity analysis (TWCA) approach to implement the synchronous production. By dividing the production time into small time windows, simple rules, heuristics and algorithms are developed to assign operations among available resources such that the inventory and operating costs are kept low. The syn-chronization is achieved by resolving the demands of each operation in the order of time windows. The approach is simple and has been implemented and tested in an actual manufacturing company. The results show that TWCA is practical and promising. TWCA has the potential to be used in either single, multiple, or parallel machines, one stage or multi-stage, job shops or flow shops, and closed or open systems. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Recognizing that some resources are inherently flexible and thus can be reassigned dynamically to processing centers as needed, and that job processing times are often a function of the amount of resource dedicated to specific operations, we formulate the flexible-resource scheduling problem with the objective of simultaneously determining the permutation job sequence, resource allocation policy, and operation start times that optimize system performance. Focusing on flexible-resource scheduling in flow shop production systems, we discuss problem complexity, identify properties of and establish lower bounds for optimal schedules, develop optimal and heuristic solution approaches, and report the results of extensive computational experimentation designed to explore the operational benefits of resource flexibility. The computational results demonstrate that the performance improvements associated with flexible-resource scheduling are substantial, and suggest that the heuristic provides an effective means for solving larger problems.},

abstract={We have studied here the real-time production scheduling problem for multiple-part-type flow shops. The system under consideration consists of many machines and produces many product types. Each part goes through the system following a pre-defined routeing and may visit each machine at most once. We consider three classes of activities: operations, failures or repairs and starvation or blockage. The scheduling objectives are to keep the actual production close to the demand and to reduce the work-in-process inventory and cycle time. A three-level hierarchical production control model is developed to regulate production for the manufacturing systems. The control policy specifies how to react to machine failures. It also tells how to allocate limited system capacity among all the part types. It utilizes the material and the space in the storage buffers to alleviate the propagation of a failure to other machines in the system. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This paper describes an implementation of JIT concepts in a medium-sized make-to-order manufacturing company. We develop a hybrid production control system for the company based on separating jobs with high production volumes following a standard routeing from relatively low-volume jobs with more complex routeings. The machines processing the high-volume standard-routeing jobs are treated as a virtual flow shop, and controlled by a hybrid push/pull system, while the remainder of the floor is managed as a job shop. Initial tests have shown that this system can significantly improve throughput and simplify the production scheduling task. We believe that the system can be applied to a wide range of industries with similar characteristics. We also describe the testing of the system and the circumstances under which its implementation was discontinued, which indicate some of the difficulties faced by small manufacturers in implementing such systems. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Ltd.},

abstract={This paper presents a production scheduling system for photographic film manufacturing industries. The scheduling system considers a hybrid flow shop, which consists of two manufacturing stages: first, the slitting of the film bulk-roll, and second, the interleaving and wrapping of the slitted sheets. In this study, several hundred final productions are produced from the film bulk-roll based on the actual demands for final products. This production scheduling system was designed as a decision support system by combining computer capability with production management. The selected performance criteria for making a schedule were ratio of setup time to processing time, work-in-process level ratio of attainable production quantity of final products to the planned production quantity. The system designed for this study showed more favourable results than the conventional system. © 1993.},

abstract={This paper describes a scheduling support system for plants that produce multiply paper bags. The machine environment in these plants may be described as a flexible flow shop. That is, there are a number of stages in series with a number of machines in parallel at each stage. The jobs have specified shipping dates as well as priorities; their processing times and setup times are known in advance. We developed a five-step algorithm that schedules all the jobs at the various stages. This algorithm has been incorporated in a system, the Bagpak Production Scheduling System (BPSS), which also contains a data base management module and a user interface module. The system has been implemented in two plants, and is used on a regular basis. It has increased considerably the accuracy of the available information regarding the production process. The scheduler, in conjunction with the system, is able to produce better schedules; he now always knows where given performance measures stand. In addition, the available information enables the scheduler to provide better service to customers.},

abstract={Frequently, several heuristic strategies are relevant to a given production scheduling problem. A choice must be made among them whenever these heuristics have different performances, and when none of them is globally better than the other ones. A neural network approach for selecting the most suited heuristic is discussed. The configuration of the shop floor, the characteristics of the manufacturing program to be carried out, and the performance criteria to optimize are presented as inputs to the first layer. The most suitable heuristic is given as output. Such a neural network is trained using a large sample of simulation results as training examples. This technique is illustrated through the dynamic scheduling problem of a simplified flow shop. A back propagation neural network finds the most appropriate dispatching rules in ninety four percent of the cases. The benefits of the neural network approach over other possible methods are discussed. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The authors present an integrated framework for order and production scheduling of a discrete-part, make-to-rder flow shop. They first formulate the integrated problem and then decompose it by applying Lagrangian relaxation into subproblems of order scheduling, production scheduling, and overtime capacity allocation, which match the operational functions in a manufacturing organization, and form a dual problem to optimize the Lagrange multipliers for relaxation, which are interpreted as marginal costs. The solution algorithm has a structure that clearly captures the interrelationship among subproblems and provides a framework for integration. Exploiting such a framework, effective rescheduling algorithms for handling new order insertion and capacity loss are developed.},

A nominal scheduling algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation and minimum cost linear network flow is developed for scheduling under nominal conditions. Fast rescheduling algorithms that exploit the economic interpretation of Lagrange multipliers and the network structure of production flows are proposed for timely adjustment of the nominal schedule to cope with disturbances. Numerical results on realistic examples demonstrated that the methodology was quite effective. It generated near-optimal schedules, provided relatively smooth adjustments and was computationally efficient.},

abstract={Short-term production scheduling is a widely seen problem in multi-product batch operations. In this paper, an effective heuristic algorithm for scheduling a set of different tasks to be processed on serial processors is presented that provides an approach towards minimizing the entire makespan and improving productivity. Flow shops with an interstage storage policy, non-zero transfer times, and non-zero setup times are considered. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated through numerous simulated problems. Statistical analysis of the output data indicates that in the situation containing up to seven tasks, the algorithm provides optimal or near optimal solutions and needs very short computation time. For a larger number of tasks, it gives up to 20% better solutions than a well-known existing algorithm. © 1992 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The simulation results show that the new heuristic improves the best heuristic in the three measures by a significant percentage, while the increase in CPU time is modest. © 1991.},

Compared to the work of Chang et al., the present work modifies the objective of scheduling to meeting due dates just in time, considers finite buffers, completes the algorithm for finding a feasible schedule, and evaluates the algorithm through numerical experimentations. Numerical results indicate that the scheduling algorithm is near-optimal and has a reasonable computational efficiency for short-term scheduling. Algorithmic features and future research issues are also addressed.},

abstract={Unlike most of the previous studies of the multiproduct, multimachine systems, hero an attempt is made to consider the man-machine overtime and idleness costs together with the usual inventory-related costs (the set-up costs, carrying costs, and back-logging costs). The major assumptions of the model include: (a) demand for each product is captive and constant; (b) single or multiple facility work centres may be employed: (c) the total manufacturing operations of any single product must be completed before another product can be started; (d) all the manufacturing facilities are set up simultaneously for each of the products and its production can be started only after all the machines are ready. The annual total variable cost function is found to be very complex. Therefore, a recursive algorithm is required to solve this function for the values of optimal produetion-cycle-thnes of the individual products, Tj*, s. As the facilities are assumed to produce only one product at a time, these cycle time values need to be fitted into a production schedule so that there is no conflict between any two products on any of the machines and so that any modification in the values of Tj*, s result in the least increase of the system's total annual variable costs. Such total annual variable costs, computed with the help of this model and its alogrithm for 15 different situations, are compared with those provided by two other known models. Each time this model performs significantly better than the other two. © 1978, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={A large flow shop with cycling has been modeled with GASP II in an effort to study the effects of scheduling rules and capacity constraints. Consisting of multiple codes requiring 150-175 operations on 55 facilities, the shop, an integrated circuit line, was previously simulated in Fortran IV for the express purpose of determining the frequency of input messages to a shop information system. However, the Fortran IV model did not possess enough flexibility or efficiency for doing further analysis. By utilizing GASP II and its list processing techniques, shorter running times and implementations of scheduling algorithms could be achieved in a compact manner. The GASP II model is also capable of handling rework loops, yield distributions for each facility, priority assignments, and multiple channels per facility. Ultimately the model will have application for production scheduling in an on-line, real-time shop information system. © 1971 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
