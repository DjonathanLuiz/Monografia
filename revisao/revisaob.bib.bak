  abstract  = {Manufacturing industries frequently encounter production scheduling problems containing device dynamic reconfiguration processes (DRP). DRP refers to dynamic device adjustments (such as replacement of tools), leading to changes in the devices’ actual processing time. It has a severe impact on the production schedule. Nevertheless, there is scarcely research upon hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (HFSP) with DRP. Besides, it is necessary to consider multiple conflict objectives in the HFSP. Thus, the multi-objective HFSP with DRP (MOHFSP-DRP) is significant in both theoretical research and application. This paper first proposes a multi-objective mathematical model (MOHFSP-DRP) that simultaneously considers the DRP and devices’ adjustable processing modes. The bi-objective of this model is to minimize both the makespan and the whole device's energy consumption. This study then proposes an improved multi-objective whale optimization algorithm (IMOWOA) to solve the MOHFSP-DRP and obtain the Pareto-based optimal solution set. After that, to verify the proposed method's effectiveness, numerical experiments are implemented based on the real-world cases in a Chinese company's digital hot-rolling workshop. Results denote that the presented IMOWOA is superior to SPEA2 and NSGA-II. Finally, the MOHFSP-DRP model and IMOWOA are applied to a real-world hot-rolling shop successfully. The real-world cases verify the proposed IMOWOA can tackle the presented MOHFSP-DRP very well. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract  = {Digital Twin (DT) is considered a key approach to enhance the system reactivity to uncertain events due to its ability to getting data from the field and triggering actions on the physical asset. Given the modern technological and rapidly changing work environment, it is likely that in the next years companies will need to retrofit their manufacturing systems by integrating DTs. In this context, it is fundamental to define the necessary steps for the development of DTs and for their integration into manufacturing systems through a DT architecture. In response to this issue, a methodology based on Virtual Commissioning is proposed. A stepwise approach is illustrated in which the DT is designed, integrated and verified using a virtual environment. The methodology is validated through the integration of a DT into a flow shop for the implementation of a scheduling reactive to machine breakdown. By following the steps of the proposed methodology, a DT architecture able to improve the makespan of the studied flow shop is developed, suggesting the potential applicability of the approach to industrial manufacturing systems. © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract  = {As the world environment is faced with the severe challenge of global warming, prefabricated construction is the path for the construction industry towards green production. Precast component manufacturers produce standardized and non-standardized components simultaneously. Non-standard components are produced make-to-order (MTO). Standard components are produced make-to-stock (MTS). In this study, the flow shop precast component production scheduling problem under a hybrid MTO-MTS environment is studied. A hybrid MTO-MTS precast component flow shop production model is developed. The object is to minimize total tardiness and earliness of delivery. An iterative job insertion algorithm based on whale optimization is developed. The proposed method involves two stages: scheduling and insertion. The first is to optimize the scheduling of customized MTO components. Then the standard MTS job is inserted. Through the computational evaluation, the performance and effect of the proposed approach are tested. It can conclude that the proposed algorithm contributes to the effective and efficient optimization of Hybrid MTO-MTS precast component production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract  = {Precast production scheduling is a key issue in prefabricated construction. Process connection and blocking are two characteristics of the flowshop production of precast components; however, they have received little attention in research on production scheduling, which may prevent actual production from following optimized scheduling schemes. In this study, an optimization model for the production scheduling of precast components was established considering process connection and blocking for minimizing the total penalty cost of earliness and tardiness. A solution for the model was designed and applied to a practical case for validation. The results indicate that the improved scheduling scheme can reduce the penalty cost and facilitate on-time delivery of precast components under two scenarios: tardiness partially allowed and no tardiness allowed. The proposed model and method can help precast plants to improve efficiency and reduce cost in addition to enhancing the practicality of precast production scheduling schemes. © 2021},

  abstract  = {This study presents a heuristic formulation of the flow shop scheduling problem by the hybrid algorithm fitness function. The genetic algorithm is used to model the time-estimates such as makespan and completion time. This paper aims to optimize the sequence-independent and sequence-dependent time-estimates. The production scheduling parameters such as permutation, non-permutation, no-wait, tardiness, and several workstations are identified from a piston manufacturing industry, in Northern India. Different machine operating parameters were collected from the piston manufacturing industry to work on reducing the makespan. The MATLAB programming in heuristics algorithm distribution function resulted in a reduction of makespan of the product by five times. The reduced completion time is 23 minutes for the piston ring product and 26 minutes in the cumulative validation of the proposed model. The cumulative optimized standard error of 0.26; (n=3) simulate and synthesize the suggested model with its validation. The system efficiency through completion time optimization ranged from 70-82 percent in piston ring, and 63-89 percent in cumulative validation of the model has been worked out for each machine type. The data generated through system optimization helps the scientific world and entrepreneurs in the advancement of sequence-based transportation. © 2021 Scientific Publishers. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {The increasing number of prefabrication projects has increased the demand for precast concrete (PC) components. The production cost of PC components significantly affects the development of the precast industry and the progress of prefabrication projects. To reduce the production cost, both the delivery delay time and component storage time must be reduced. Flow-arrangement optimization is generally performed using the genetic algorithm. However, this method cannot always yield a perfect optimal solution. Moreover, the traditional optimization model does not consider the impact of the overtime hours of workers on the project costs. In this study, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model was developed to optimize the production scheduling by minimizing the storage and delay times. The total delay time for the components was reduced by 55.3%, from 3.8 to 1.7 h, and the total storage time for finished components was reduced by 20.3%, from 6.4 to 5.1 h. Then, the use of the MILP model was extended to optimize the production scheduling by minimizing overtime. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of MILP were verified by comparing the results. The total overtime decreased by approximately 24.5%, from 11.5 to 9.3 h. It has been demonstrated that the proposed MILP model can achieve a better production sequence with less overtime. The findings of this research can be deployed in optimizing efficiency in the real-life scheduling of production sequence. © 2021 Zhansheng Liu et al.},

  abstract  = {An iterated greedy algorithm (IGA) is a simple and powerful heuristic algorithm. It is widely used to solve flow-shop scheduling problems (FSPs), an important branch of production scheduling problems. IGA was first developed to solve an FSP in 2007. Since then, various FSPs have been tackled by using IGA-based methods, including basic IGA, its variants, and hybrid algorithms with IGA integrated. Up until now, over 100 articles related to this field have been published. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing tutorial or review paper of IGA. Thus, we focus on FSPs and provide a tutorial and comprehensive literature review of IGA-based methods. First, we introduce a framework of basic IGA and give an example to clearly show its procedure. To help researchers and engineers learn and apply IGA to their FSPs, we provide an open platform to collect and share related materials. Then, we make classifications of the solved FSPs according to their scheduling scenarios, objective functions, and constraints. Next, we classify and introduce the specific methods and strategies used in each phase of IGA for FSPs. Besides, we summarize IGA variants and hybrid algorithms with IGA integrated, respectively. Finally, we discuss the current IGA-based methods and already-solved FSP instances, as well as some important future research directions according to their deficiency and open issues. IEEE},

  abstract  = {The permutation flow shop scheduling problem (PFSSP) is a typical production scheduling problem and it has been proved to be a nondeterministic polynomial (NP-hard) problem when its scale is larger than 3. The whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is a new swarm intelligence algorithm which performs well for PFSSP. But the stability is still low, and the optimization results are not too good. On this basis, we optimize the parameters of WOA through chaos theory, and put forward a chaotic whale algorithm (CWA). Firstly, in this paper, the proposed CWA is combined with Nawaz-Ensco-Ham (NEH) and largest-rank-value (LRV) rule to initialize the population. Next, chaos theory is applied to WOA algorithm to improve its convergence speed and stability. On this basis, we also use cross operator and reversal-insertion operator to enhance the search ability of the algorithm. Finally, the improved local search algorithm is used to optimize the job sequence to find the minimum makespan. In several experiments, different benchmarks are used to investigate the performance of CWA. The experimental results show that CWA has better performance than other scheduling algorithms. © 2021 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press B.V.},

  abstract  = {Multiple local assignment rules are common in production lines with complex production elements to direct the production process. Different local assignment rules have different degrees of impact on each production evaluation index, which aggravates the conflict between each production evaluation index. In order to solve the problem of increasing conflict among multiple production evaluation indexes in complex production scheduling process, based on the mathematical model of flexible flow shop with limited buffer and public buffer (FFSP-PB), game elements such as game player, game strategy and game order are established according to the idea of multiplayer cooperative game, and design the corresponding game strategy selection method to predict and control the game behavior of each player in the problem. Then a conflict resolution method of production evaluation index based on multiplayer cooperative game is proposed to solve the conflict between multiple production evaluation indexes, and then improve each production evaluation index. Finally, according to the actual production data of a bus manufacturing enterprise based on flexible manufacturing mode, several simulation schemes are designed to analyze and verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method in resolving the conflicts between production evaluation indexes, and provides a reliable new solution for the conflict resolution of production evaluation index in the field of flexible manufacturing. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Production and maintenance tasks apply for access to the same resources. Maintenance-related machine downtime reduces productivity, but the costs incurred due to unplanned machine failures often outweigh the costs associated with predictive maintenance. Costs incurred due to unplanned machine failure include corrective maintenance, reworks, delays in deliveries, breaks in the work of employees and machines. Therefore, scheduling of production and maintenance tasks should be considered jointly. The problem of generating a predictive schedule with given constrains is considered. The objective of the paper is to develop a scheduling method that reflects the operation of the production system and nature of disturbances. The original value of the paper is the development of the method of a basic schedule generation with the application of the Ant Colony Optimisation. A predictive schedule is built by planning the technical inspection of the machine at time of the predicted failure-free time. The numerical simulations are performed for job/flow shop systems. © 2020 by the authors. Li-censee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract  = {Steelmaking and the continuous-casting (SCC) scheduling problem is a realistic hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with continuous-casting production at the last stage. This study considers the SCC scheduling problem with diverse products, which is a vital and difficult problem in steel plants. To tackle this problem, this study first presents the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to minimize the objective of makespan. Then, an improved migrating birds optimization algorithm (IMBO) is proposed to tackle this considered NP-hard problem. In the proposed IMBO, several improvements are employed to achieve the proper balance between exploration and exploitation. Specifically, a two-level decoding procedure is designed to achieve feasible solutions; the simulated annealing-based acceptance criterion is employed to ensure the diversity of the population and help the algorithm to escape from being trapped in local optima; a competitive mechanism is developed to emphasize exploitation capacity by searching around the most promising solution space. The computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed IMBO obtains competing performance and it outperforms seven other implemented algorithms in the comparative study. © 2020 by the authors.

  abstract  = {Production scheduling is of great significance in improving production effectiveness while the energy-efficient problem is one of most concerned problems for researchers and manufacturers. Thus, this study investigates the energy-efficient distributed permutation flow shop scheduling problem (DPFSP) with the objectives of makespan and energy consumption. The DPFSP is an extension of permutation flow shop problem (PFSP) considering a set of identical factories. This paper presents a multi-objective mixed integer programming model based on the three sub-problems: allocating jobs among factories, scheduling the jobs in each factory and determining speed upon each job. A multi-objective whale swarm algorithm (MOWSA) is proposed to solve this energy-efficient DPFSP. A new problem-dependent local search is developed to improve the exploitation capability of MOWSA. Moreover, the updating exploitation mechanism is presented to enhance energy efficiency without affecting production efficiency. Finally, the extensive comparison experiments are designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed MOWSA, problem-dependent local search and updating exploitation mechanism. The results indicate the effectiveness of MOWSA and the superior performance over NSGA-II, SPEA2, PAES and MDEA, and also demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the energy consumption compared with other algorithms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {Numerous optimization problems exist in the product and process design, engineering, and planning, as well as production management, and the evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been proved to be effective optimization methods to solve these problems. However, how to choose the appropriate EA is one of the key issues due to the variety of EAs and lack of experience. Under this circumstance, firstly, a novel EA recommendation system framework is designed and proposed, and the implementation of the EA recommendation method is also described in this paper. Then, computational experiments are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method on the basis of 14 typical benchmark problems and 20 classical EAs. Finally, a case study regarding permutation flow shop scheduling is also carried out to test its effectiveness and accuracy. The proposed recommendation method provides a new way to select the appropriate EAs scientifically and reasonably to solve a given optimization problem. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract  = {Shop Floor Control (SFC) is one of the main concepts in Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRPII), and production scheduling is a key element in SFC. This paper studies the hybrid flow shop scheduling problem, where jobs are multiprocessors. The objective is to minimize total completion time. Although there are several papers considering the hybrid flow-shop scheduling problem with multiprocessor tasks, none has proposed a mathematical model for this problem. At first, the two problems (fixed and selective cases) are mathematically formulated by mixed integer linear programming models. By using commercial software, the model is used to solve the small instances of the problems. Moreover, an elephant herding optimization is developed to solve large instances of the problems. To numerically evaluate the proposed algorithm, it is compared with three available algorithms in the literature. © 2020 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Production scheduling is an important research topic widely studied during past few decades. However, many manufacturers still fail to successfully deploy scheduling algorithms and systems, even though information and communication technologies can be used to collect and process data associated with production scheduling under modern smart manufacturing environment. The primary problem is that many scheduling algorithms and systems did not consider diverse variety of scheduling requirements of real production systems. Especially, production schedulers in small make-to-order manufacturers have much trouble in utilizing such algorithms and systems. In order to address this issue, this paper aims to propose a functional architecture of production scheduling system for small make-to-order manufactures under smart manufacturing environment and develop a flexible scheduling algorithm for this system. For illustration, the proposed system and algorithm are applied to a two-machine flow shop scheduling problem, and it is expected that this paper will provide a meaningful insight into the user experiences of production scheduling systems. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract  = {Prior studies are lacking which address permutation flow shop scheduling problems and hybrid flow shop scheduling problems together to help firms find the optimized scheduling strategy. The permutation flow shop scheduling problem and hybrid flow shop scheduling problems are important production scheduling types, which widely exist in industrial production fields. This study aimed to acquire the best scheduling strategy for making production plans. An improved fireworks algorithm is proposed to minimize the makespan in the proposed strategies. The proposed improved fireworks algorithm is compared with the fireworks algorithm, and the improvement strategies include the following: (1) A nonlinear radius is introduced and the minimum explosion amplitude is checked to avoid the waste of optimal fireworks; (2) The original Gaussian mutation operator is replaced by a hybrid operator that combines Cauchy and Gaussian mutation to improve the search ability; and (3) An elite group selection strategy is adopted to reduce the computing costs. Two instances from the permutation flow shop scheduling problem and hybrid flow shop scheduling problems were used to evaluate the improved fireworks algorithm's performance, and the computational results demonstrate the improved fireworks algorithm's superiority. © 2020 by the authors.},

In this paper, we investigate a General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) metaheuristic for simulation-based energy-aware production scheduling, including optimization of setup times for thermal processes. The fitness evaluation is based on a hybrid discrete/continuous simulation model that provides assessment of energy costs including time-dependent energy pricing together with other production goals, like storage costs, while also considering dynamic interdependencies between production machinery and building facilities. We demonstrate the method on a case study of flow shop scheduling in an industrial bakery in different scenarios. Comparisons show a potential gain of 6% when considering energy costs as an optimization target within PPC. ©2020 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS)},

  abstract  = {Considering that process planning and production scheduling are independent of each other in a hybrid flow-shop, this study categorizes the process route into parallel process-set, batch set and unordered process-set, and builds a multi-objective optimization model to minimize the maximum completion time and the minimum processing cost. An improved artificial bee colony algorithm has been developed to solve the model. A segmented decoding method based on the insertion principle and the release time of the predecessor process is proposed to effectively use the idle time of the machine. A dynamic triggering neighborhood mechanism is introduced to enhance the local searchabilit of the algorithm. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of this algorithm to solve such problems are verified via simulation experiments. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, a model for integrating production scheduling and maintenance planning is proposed for flow shop production system. The suggested model in this paper is based on the optimal jobs sequence for jobs that will be processed in multiple machines connected in series. The objective of this study is to find the optimal sequence for jobs while reducing the total production and maintenance costs. The model works by generating an initial solution using longest processing time (LPT) dispatching rule. Then, tabu search algorithm is established to obtain the optimal sequence for jobs. Computational experiments are performed on problems with five serially machines which are assigned to process eight diverse jobs from the same product family. The result is compared with the genetic algorithm optimization technique under individual PM scheme for obtaining superior solutions that has been proved in the literature to be one of the best approach. The computational results show that the recommended approach is qualified over the simulation based genetic algorithm optimization technique. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {A dynamic optimized production scheduling which takes into account demand fluctuation and uncertainty is very critical for the efficient performance of Prefabricated Component Supply Chain. Previous studies consider only the conditions in the production factory and develop corresponding models, ignoring the dynamic demand fluctuation that often occurs at the construction site and its impact on the entire lifecycle of prefabricated construction project. This paper proposes a dynamic flow shop scheduling model for prefabricated components production, which incorporates demand fluctuation such as the advance of due date, insertion of urgent component and order cancellation. An actual prefabrication construction project has been used to validate the proposed multi-objective genetic algorithm model. The experimental results show that the proposed model can achieve a cost saving of up to 43.2%, which shows that the proposed model can cope well with the occurrence of demand fluctuation. This research contributes to the dynamic decision support system for managing prefabricated components. © 2020, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Many optimization algorithms have been proposed to solve hybrid flowshop scheduling problem (HFSP). However, with the development of industry and society, labor right and labor safety have become important problem to consider in production scheduling. So the green HFSP considering makespan, noise and dust pollution becomes an urgent problem to be solved. In this paper, the rider optimization algorithm (ROA) is modified into the multi-objective rider optimization algorithm (MOROA) using Pareto archive and neighborhood sorting techniques. The Pareto archive and neighborhood sorting technology make the Pareto optimal solution set of MOROA have higher coverage and more solutions. Then MOROA is discretized into discrete MOROA (DMOROA) to solve the HFSP considering makespan, noise and dust pollution. DMOROA is tested on 10, 30 and 50 jobs HFSP considering makespan, noise and dust pollution. The test results are compared with two multi-objective algorithms to verify the performance of DMOROA. And the test results verify that the DMOROA is superior to the comparison algorithms in search accuracy, number of non-dominated solutions, diversity of solution set and stability. Therefore, DMOROA is effective in solving multi-objective HFSP considering makespan, noise and dust pollution. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Scheduling is a very complex but important problem in the real world environment applications. Production scheduling with the objective of minimising the makespan is an important task in manufacturing systems. For most scheduling problems studied so far, the processing time of each job on each machine has been assumed as a real number. However in real world applications the processing time is often imprecise which means the processing time may vary dynamically because of some human factor or operating faults. This paper considers an n jobs and m machines flow shop scheduling problem of minimising the makespan. In this work fuzzy numbers are used to represent the processing times in the flow shop scheduling. Fuzzy and neural network-based concepts are applied to the flow shop scheduling problems to determine an optimal job sequence with the objective of minimising the makespan. The performance of our proposed hybrid model is compared with the existing methods selected from different papers. Some problems are solved with the present method and it is found suitable and workable in all the cases. A comparison of our present method with the existing methods is also provided in this work.

  abstract   = {Scheduling is defined as the process of allocating resources over time to perform a collection of tasks within a certain period of time. PT KHI Pipe Industries in Cilegon Indonesia, has been producing high quality longitudinal and spiral weld steel pipes. The company uses FCFS (first come first serve) rule for scheduling their jobs, which means that job processing based on the first incoming prioritizes orders. In October 2018 there was delay in their production, namely 1771 pipes are still in work in process (WIP) of total demand is 6, 296 pipes. Based on these problems, this research tries to determine a better production scheduling by getting minimum makespan as scheduling performance. Heuristic and metaheuristic methods used in this research for minimizing the makespan, there are Campbell Dudek Smith (CDS) for heuristic and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for metaheuristic. We also proposed a new heuristic algorithm for this problem. The results show the makespan of each method, there are CDS method: 742.87 hours, PSO method: 711.96 hours, Proposed Heuristic Algorithm method: 694.64 hours, and existing production scheduling of FCFS rules is 746.43 hours. Based on the results, the Proposed Heuristic Algorithm has smaller makespan than the others. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Multi-objective flow shop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times (MOFSP-SDST) is a class of important production scheduling problem with strong industry background. In this paper, a MOFSP-SDST mathematic model with the objectives of total production cost, makespan, mean flow time and mean idle time of machines is developed. To solve this multi-objective model, a novel multi-objective approach based on fuzzy correlation entropy analysis is proposed firstly. In this multi-objective approach, two types of objective function value sequences, namely the referenced function value sequence and comparable function value sequence, are constructed and mapped into two types of fuzzy sets by a modified relative membership function. The fuzzy correlation entropy coefficient between the two types of fuzzy sets is used to select better solutions in a multi-objective problem. A discrete multi-objective fireworks algorithm (DMOFWA) is proposed to address the MOFSP-SDST. In the DMOFWA, a new multi-objective approach is adopted to handle the multiple objectives and guide the search of the algorithm. Two kinds of machine learning strategies are adopted, namely opposition-based learning (OBL) and clustering analysis (CA). The OBL is employed to learn from the current search space and improve the exploration ability of DMOFWA, and the CA based on fuzzy correlation entropy coefficient is proposed to cluster firework individuals. Computational and statistical results show that the novel multi-objective approach, OBL and CA strategies can effectively improve the performance of DMOFWA. Furthermore, the results indicate that DMOFWA performs better than four state-of-the-art comparison algorithms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract   = {In this paper, we propose a scheduling algorithm for on-time production in a hybrid flow shop manufacturing process. The main objective of our proposed algorithm is to schedule the operation of machine so as to maximize the number of machines that substitute the operation of failed machines, while satisfying the maximum allowable production time. To this end, the algorithm maximizes time interval between operations at different stages to maximize the number of substitute machines to be allocated in the time interval. Max-min optimization is employed to achieve the objective of the proposed algorithm. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with that of the algorithm minimizing the makespan of a schedule. Our numerical results show that the proposed algorithm improves the robustness of a manufacturing process prone to machine failure. The performance of the proposed algorithm is about three times as high as that of the algorithm minimizing the makespan in the manufacturing process, where one hundred of jobs are to be processed. © 2019 IEEE.},

  abstract   = {The aim of this paper is to address the energy-efficient scheduling problems in the hybrid flow shop problem (HFSP) with machine maintenance. For this aim, the mixed integer programming model (MIPM) considering energy consumption and machine maintenance is proposed firstly. Given the NP-hard nature of the model, a hybrid multi-objective algorithm (HMOA) combining an improved algorithm based on the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II-imp) with a heuristic algorithm is developed to solve MIPM. The NSGA-II-imp designs a new elite remained strategy for the purpose of balancing two conflict objectives and a heuristic algorithm is mainly designed to add machine maintenance during production scheduling. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared to GA, SA-GA, NSGA-II separately based on extensive numerical experiments. Results show the effectiveness of the algorithm in this paper. © 2019 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {An important production planning problem is how to best schedule jobs (or lots) when each job consists of a large number of identical parts. This problem is often approached by breaking each job/lot into sublots (termed lot streaming). When the total number of transfer sublots in lot streaming is large, the computational effort to calculate job completion time can be significant. However, researchers have largely neglected this computation time issue. To provide a practical method for production scheduling for this situation, we propose a method to address the n-job, m-machine, and lot streaming flow-shop scheduling problem. We consider the variable sublot sizes, setup time, and the possibility that transfer sublot sizes may be bounded because of capacity constrained transportation activities. The proposed method has three stages: initial lot splitting, job sequencing optimization with efficient calculation of the makespan/total flow time criterion, and transfer adjustment. Computational experiments are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the three-stage method. The experiments reveal that relative to results reported on lot streaming problems for five standard datasets, the proposed method saves substantial computation time and provides better solutions, especially for large-size problems. © 2019, Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract   = {Production scheduling is defined as the way of allocating resources or machines to process a set of tasks within a certain period. A flow shop production system requires scheduling to set up a job priority. This research takes place in a steel company located in Cilegon, Banten, which produces Bar Mill and Section Mill. There are two types of bar mill products, namely deformed bar mill and plain bar mill. These types of products are distinguished from their diameters. Among all products, the highest demand for bar mill Type is D.16, D.19, D.22, D.25 and D.32. However, during the period of time, the sequence of producing the Bar Mill is timely basis without considering the volume of the demand. This condition leads to longer completion time and makespan. Therefore, to solve the problem, we propose the application of production scheduling method by combining particle swarm optimization with Nawaz Enscore and Ham (NEH) algorithm as the initialization. The result shows that there is an improvement in makespan after applying the proposed method. Total makespan for existing condition is 721.87 h. The proposed method is capable to reduce the makespan into 695.76 h by applying particle swarm optimization method with random initialization. The scheduling using particle swarm optimization method with NEH initialization generates makespan of 678.04 h. Based on the results and analysis, the application of particle swarm optimization method with NEH initialization show a better performance compared to other scheduling methods. © 2019 Author(s).},

  abstract   = {The employee allocation and production scheduling are the key factors in manufacturing enterprises. Especially, in small and medium enterprises, the working employees are the main resources of the production process. The employees gain orientation in variety skills; they can be assigned to any processes. Moreover, when the employees work for a long period, the productivity drops because of their working fatigue. Thus, the initial flow shop scheduling plan may not result as expected. This paper proposes to apply the re-optimization process for employee allocation during the production period. However, the re-optimization requires the setup time to start the new process. The proposed model introduces the rescheduling checking procedure to properly invoke the optimization process. The genetic algorithm is applied in the optimization process. The evaluation results show that the proposed model can reduce the makespan with the suitable rescheduling optimization process. © 2019 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Production scheduling is important for the electronic component manufacturing industry made from silicone rubber. Product completion time is one of the problems faced by the company. It often happens that products completion incapable of meeting due dates. This is caused by the inability of the molding workstation to complete the production process in the expected time. The production process requires 6 workstations with a hybrid flow-shop process, and one of them is a molding workstation. The problem encountered was to schedule 37 types of products with different order quantities and due dates. The lot size for each batch is different for each type of product, therefore each type of product with different order quantity will have different number of batches. The aim of the research is to minimize the total tardiness in batch completion time, using the metaheuristic approach Simulated Annealing (SA) with Python programming. The case study in this paper is to arrange the schedule of 37 types of products consisting of 574 batches at a molding workstation with 45 parallel machines that are independent. The results of data processing showed that total tardiness in molding machines was 13700 minutes. © 2020 SERSC.},

  abstract  = {The energy-aware scheduling problem is a multi-objective optimization problem where the main goal is to achieve energy savings without affecting productivity in a manufacturing system. In this work, we present an approach for energy-aware flow shop scheduling problem and energy-aware job shop scheduling problem considering the process speed as the main energy-related decision variable. This approach allows one to set the appropriate process speed for every considered operation in the corresponding machine. When the speed is high, the processing time is short but the energy demand increases, and vice versa. Therefore, two objectives are worked together: a production objective, paired with an energy efficiency objective. A generic elitist multi-objective genetic algorithm was implemented to solve both problems. Results from a simple comparative design of experiments and a nonparametric test show that it is possible to smooth the energy demand profile and obtain reductions that average 19.8% in energy consumption. This helps to reduce peak loads and drops on applied energy sources demand, stabilizing the conversion units operational efficiency across the entire operational time with a minimum effect on the production maximum completion time (makespan). © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.},

  abstract   = {Genetic programming-based automatic heuristic generation is a hyper heuristic that can produce the key functions in a meta-heuristic for a problem. This paper studies the automatic heuristic generation method to automated generate dispatching rules for the hybrid flow shop scheduling problem, a classic scheduling problem with strong industrial background. First, a meta-heuristic based on list scheduling is given. Then a genetic programming is proposed to generate a dispatching rule which is to produce a job list in the metaheuristic. Experimental results indicate that the generated dispatching rules are superior to the classic rules. © 2019 IEEE.},

  abstract   = {Nowadays, energy demand has grown rapidly and remarkably in the different sector. More particularly the industry currently consumes about half of the world's energy. Furthermore, there has been a growing concern over the environmental impact of traditional manufacturing, especially in terms of energy consumption and related emissions of carbon dioxide. Besides the adoption of new equipment, production scheduling could play a key role in reducing the total energy consumption of a manufacturing plant. This article deals with the non-permutation flow shop scheduling problems with non-availability intervals to minimize the total energy consumption (TEC) and makespan (Cmax). Specifically, two kinds of unavailability constraints are investigated and the jobs are non-resumable in both cases. In the first case, the non- availability intervals are periodically fixed and known in advance. In the second case, the intervals are flexible and the machines' continuous working time cannot exceed a maximum allowed time. The mixed binary integer programming model is provided for deriving the optimal schedules. The problems of minimising makespan in such flow shops are proved Non-deterministic Polynomial-time hard in strong sense. To the best of our knowledge, no papers considering both production scheduling and unavailability constraints with minimizing the total of energy consumption and makespan in flow shop. The gap between theory and practice prevents the satisfying performance of the schedules in industry. The purpose of this paper is to establish a joint model for integrating the production and unavailability constraints to optimize the bi-objective of the total energy consumption and makespan simultaneously; and to make the theory applied in practice more efficaciously. © 2019 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Production and preventive maintenance are very important functions in industry which act on the same resources. However, in most real workshops, the scheduling of their respective activities is independent and the constraint that they cannot be accomplished at the same time is rarely considered. Therefore, we are facing a joint scheduling problem of production and preventive maintenance tasks. In addition, this joint scheduling risks at any moment to deviate from the theoretical desired performances when facing disturbances due to various causes. Thus, we must still seek the most robust scheduling, i.e. the one that resists to uncertainties. This paper proposes a new approach to study robustness of joint production and maintenance scheduling in permutation flow shop workshops. The studied scheduling are generated according to two strategies: sequential and integrated. As methods of scheduling resolution, we will consider the well-known ants colony optimization, genetic algorithm, tabu search and some hybridizations of these methods. Our approach can be applied to other joint scheduling generating methods. In particular, we study how insertion of maintenance tasks can contribute to the robustness of production scheduling and how some scheduling strategies and methods are more robust than others. Several experimental results show the merits of our approach. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract  = {Flow shop scheduling problems with queue time constraints abound in many types of industries. The waiting times between consecutive steps in flow shop production with queue time constraints cannot exceed a given interval. Typically, managers use mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to schedule the process starting times of jobs in a queue. However, as the number of jobs in the system increases, the MILP-based model cannot return an optimal solution within a reasonable time because of its combinatorial nature. This paper proposes a mixed integer programming with Lagrangian relaxation (MIPLAR) method to solve the time-indexed MILP model with a separable structure for the production scheduling problem with queue time constraints. Lagrangian relaxation techniques are used to decompose the problem into job-level subproblems, which are solved by dynamic programming. The subgradient method is used to solve the Lagrangian dual problem. A 4.6-month simulation study demonstrates that the proposed MIPLAR method improves the scrap count by a percentage range from 32.1% to 83.7% across the studied 16 scenarios compared to the first-in-first-out (FIFO) rule while maintaining the same range of the throughput. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a survey on the applications of optimal control to scheduling in production, supply chain and Industry 4.0 systems with a focus on the deterministic maximum principle. The first objective is to derive major contributions, application areas, limitations, as well as research and application recommendations for the future research. The second objective is to explain control engineering models in terms of industrial engineering and production management. To achieve these objectives, optimal control models, qualitative methods of performance analysis and computational methods for optimal control are considered. We provide a brief historic overview and clarify major mathematical fundamentals whereby the control engineering terms are brought into correspondence with industrial engineering and management. The survey allows the grouping of models with only terminal constraints with application to master production scheduling, models with hybrid terminal-logical constraints with applications to short term job and flow shop scheduling, and hybrid structural-terminal-logical constraints with applications to customised assembly systems such as Industry 4.0. Computational algorithms in state, control and adjoint variable spaces are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  abstract   = {PT. Avesta Continental Pack is a manufacturer of flexible packaging for pharmaceutical products. The company faces ineffective production scheduling and repeatedly failed to finish orders at the expected time limit. Customers requesting orders in different finishing time contributes in causing delays in the delivery process. Consequently, customers ended up claiming the fee because of the late delivery. Therefore, a more advanced scheduling system will assist the company in managing the delivery time. The purpose of this research is to establish the most effective job scheduling arrangement to minimize mean tardiness as well as mean lateness job. As the production process uses flow shop method, this research applies heuristic methods, such as Earliest Due Date (EDD) method, Short Processing Time (SPT), Nawaz, Enscore, and Ham (NEH) algorithm and Campbell, Dudek, and Smith (CDS) algorithm. The result shows that SPT method provides the most optimum outcome, specifically by reducing mean tardiness by 801.81 minutes or 85.57% and decreasing mean lateness job by 2 or 66.67%. The best job sequence is subsequently job 8 - job 4 - job 1 - job 6 - job 7 - job 5 - job 2 - job 3, which minimizes the average delay time from 937.05 minutes to 135.24 minutes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract   = {PT. Plasindo Elok is a manufacturer that has been producing plastic protector and packaging system specifically for oil and gas company. All kinds of product which is produced by PT.Plasindo Elok, have the same sequences and at several production stages, there are a number of parallel machine with its different capacity (hybrid flow shop). The existing production scheduling was based on First Come First Serve (FCFS). The objective of this paper is to design a scheduling system to minimize makespan which could reduce WIP and total production cost. Flow shop heuristic method which is used as a basis to get the optimal makespan are NEH and CDS algorithm. Furthermore, the scheduling sequence of NEH and CDS are used to generate an initial sequence for metaheuristic method, Tabu Search (TS). The result of data processing showed that CDS algorithm represented the minimum makespan compared to NEH algorithm. The proposed methods CDS-TS and NEH-TS, produced the same minimum makespan, 14861,61 minutes with different mean flow time. Both hybrid algorithm (NEH-TS and CDS-TS) could reduce total makespan to 1697,93 minutes or 28,30 hours. The proposed method given to the company was NEH-TS with the production sequence of P10 - P12 - P13 - P8 - P7 - P4 - P5 - P2 - P1 - P11 - P9 -P3 - P14 - P6, NEH-TS was the best algorithm compared to NEH, CDS, and CDS-TS because it produced theleast makespan and mean flow time. In addition to facilitate company scheduling calculation, researcher designsa Java based scheduling program. © IEOM Society International.},

  abstract  = {The competition manufacturing companies face has driven the development of novel and efficient methods that enhance the decision making process. In this work, a specific flow shop scheduling problem of practical interest in the industry is presented and formalized using a mathematical programming model. The problem considers a manufacturing system arranged as a work cell that takes into account the transport operations of raw material and final products between the manufacturing cell and warehouses. For solving this problem, we present a multiobjective metaheuristic strategy based on simulated annealing, the Pareto Archived Simulated Annealing (PASA). We tested this strategy on two kinds of benchmark problem sets proposed by the authors. The first group is composed by small-sized problems. On these tests, PASA was able to obtain optimal or near-optimal solutions in significantly short computing times. In order to complete the analysis, we compared these results to the exact Pareto front of the instances obtained with augmented ε-constraint method. Then, we also tested the algorithm in a set of larger problems to evaluate its performance in more extensive search spaces. We performed this assessment through an analysis of the hypervolume metric. Both sets of tests showed the competitiveness of the Pareto Archived Simulated Annealing to efficiently solve this problem and obtain good quality solutions while using reasonable computational resources. © 2019 by the authors.},

  abstract   = {Production and operations management is becoming increasingly challenging in a manufacturing system nowadays, as many processes are involved in the system and production performance is evaluated from different perspectives. Therefore, trade-off balancing is critical to achieve sustainable operations management. We propose a trade-off balancing model, and use our state space (SS) heuristic to show the effectiveness and efficiency in balancing trade-offs between utilization (Util) and work-in-process (WIP) inventories in a flow line. Our SS heuristic is superior to the best-known methods to max(Util) and min(WIP) respectively, showing consistent performance on trade-off balancing for adaptive production scheduling and control with variation in processing times. © 2018 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {In the last decades, the permutation flowshop scheduling problem (PFSP) has been thoroughly studied in combinatorial optimization and scheduling research. The most common objectives for this problem are makespan, total flowtime, and total tardiness. Furthermore, most production scheduling problems naturally involve multiples conflicting objectives to be optimized. Over the years, several approaches have been proposed to solve multi-objective PFSP. In the multi-objective optimization field of research, the multi-objective evolutionary algorithms based on decomposition has been recognized as one of the main strategies for solving multi-objective optimization problems. In this paper, we present a MOEA that integrates the decomposition approach and a probability model for ranking data (particularly, the Mallows model) for solving PFSP minimizing two and three objectives. We have conducted an extensive experimental study using a well-known benchmark set. In the bi-objective case, the proposed algorithm achieves competitive results compared to the best-known approximated Pareto fronts from the literature. In the tri-objective scenario, our algorithm achieves the best results in comparison to some state-of-the-art decomposition-based algorithms. © 2018},

  abstract  = {In the past decades, a significant amount of attention has been attracted by operational production-distribution scheduling models. These models suggest that compared with hierarchical planning processes, the optimal plan can be achieved by considering the production and distribution decisions at the same time. For example, managers can schedule the production the delivery tasks consecutively. In a typical two-stage semi-continuous flow shop production plant, raw materials are converted into continuous resources in the first stage, and then, in the second stage, they are fed to the discrete-production processes of end products. Machines are employed to guarantee the continuous running of certain types of processes in each stage. Furthermore, the processing sequence at the first stage determines the readiness time and costs of resources. The product family is the basic scheduling element, and products sharing common materials and manufacturing procedures are categorised in the same product family. Taking these dependencies derived in practical manufacturing processes into consideration, various industrial cases can be fit in this model, including the food and drink industries or the metallurgical industry. This paper finally presented numerical-based tests on specific cases from an industrial application. © 2018, DAAAM International Vienna. All rights reserved.},

And preventive maintenance and emergency repair cause the unavailability of machine will affect production efficiency. In order to solve the conflict between dispatch schedule and preventive maintenance plan. This paper develop a joint optimization on a hybrid flow shop model including not only batch processor but also discrete processor. And a preventive maintenance strategy based on reliability is designed. The multi-objective is to simultaneously minimize the makespan and total production cost. Particle swarm optimization and heuristic algorithm are proposed to solve the problem. Then a large number of computational instances are conducted. The experimental results show that joint optimization are superior compared with independent decision-making. And it also show the effects of different unit production cost for batch size in the end. © 2018 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Most of the prior investigations related to production scheduling problems have solely focused on the optimization of an individual criterion under a single constraint; nevertheless, this is most of the time out of true in a real situation. This paper deals with multi machines permutation flow shop scheduling with limited buffers capacity and different release dates of jobs, where the performance is measured by the minimization of the weighted sum of maximum tardiness and makespan. To tackle this NP-hard problem, we present a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP). Thereafter, using CPLEX software, we generate a set of tests in an endeavor to examine formulation for dissimilar size problems in terms of optimality solution and computational CPU time complexity. Experiment results show that overall the proposed model is computationally avaricious to solve the considering problem. © 2018 PEI, University of Maribor. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Production scheduling has a considerable impact on productivity and resource assignment. In many situations, every job has an owner, which is called an agent. Since the agents are independent and selfish, it is possible that they have not any incentive to cooperate. Scheduling games help us to understand interactions between the agents. In this study, we consider a real firm with a flow shop manufacturing system that receives various orders from different agents so that each order belongs to a unique agent and includes some jobs. We propose a Nash bargaining model to find a compromise solution among agents. We suppose the utilities of the agents in disagreement point are non-deterministic. Therefore, to overcome this problem, we used linear programming with interval coefficients in order to find the best and the worst Nash bargaining solution. To find a compromised solution, we propose an improved genetic algorithm and compare it with other meta-heuristic algorithms. The comparisons indicate that the proposed algorithm has a good potential to evaluation of Nash bargaining problem in hybrid flow shop environment. Based on the results to reach an agreement between agents, it is required to create a trade-off between usage rates of fastest machines at each stage especially in bottleneck stages and total processing time of orders. The results indicate that the Nash bargaining solution is suitable to solve real-life agent-based production scheduling with the consideration of interactions among the agents when disagreement points are under uncertainty. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract  = {Permutation flow shop scheduling is a part of production scheduling problems. It allows “n” jobs to be processed on “m” machines. All the jobs are processed in all the machines, and the sequence of jobs being processed is the same in all the machines. It plays a vital role in both automated manufacturing industries and nondeterministic polynomial hard problem. Gravitational emulation local search algorithm is a randomization-based concept algorithm. It is used iteratively as the local search procedure for exploring the local optimum solution. Modified gravitational emulation local search algorithm is used for both exploring and exploiting the optimum solution for permutation flow shop scheduling problems. In this work, modified gravitational emulation local search algorithm is proposed to solve the permutation flow shop scheduling problems with the objectives such as minimization of makespan and total flow time. The computational results show that the performance solution of the proposed algorithm gives better results than the previous author’s approaches. Statistical tools are also used for finding out a relationship that exists between the two variables (makespan and total flow time) and to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach against the previous approaches in the literature. © 2016, © IMechE 2016.},

  abstract  = {We investigate a new variant of the hybrid flow shop problem (HFSP) considering machine blocking and both sequence-independent and sequence-dependent setup times. Since the HFSP is NP-hard, we propose heuristic algorithms along with priority rules based on the traditional SPT and LPT rules. We carried out computational experiments on simulated problem instances to test the performance of the priority rules. The objective function adopted was makespan minimization, and we used the rate of success and the relative deviation as performance criteria. The results indicate superiority of LPT-based rules. On instances with sequence-independent setup times, the LP rule, which is based on the non-increasing sorting of total processing times, outperformed other rules in most tested instances. In instances with sequence-dependent setup times, the LPS rule, which is based on the non-increasing sum of processing time and average setup times, outperformed other rules in most tested instances. © 2018, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.},

  abstract  = {The typical production system in carton box production companies is cell-production. These cells normally benefit from a mobile robot which serves the machines according to a given schedule. One of the main problems of such companies is finding the order of robot moves in a way that the time required for completing all jobs is minimized. In the studied case in this research, each cell contains three machines of which, two or three of them might be activated for production process depending on the product type. These machines are equipped with a one-capacitated input and output buffer. Considering the fact that the machines are capable of performing any operation, the assignments of the jobs to them may have several alternatives. The one-capacitated buffers make the robot scheduling more complex as they act as extra stations to be served by the robot (contribute to exponential increase in job assignments permutation). This study aims to deal with this complexity and provide a decision-making toolbox for business owners to determine and employ the best robot moving schedule according to the characteristics of the problem. The mentioned approach significantly contributes to decision-maker’s effective time management and results in adopting a better production scheme for each production cycle. In line with this prospect, this research proposes a sequential part production matrix (SPPM) to determine feasible robot move strategies through which the best scheduling scheme is introduced for different problem configurations. Additionally, a metaheuristic algorithm is proposed to determine the best robot move strategy for cases with more active machines in a cell as manual determination of the robot move strategies becomes exhaustive in such cases. © 2017, German Academic Society for Production Engineering (WGP).},

  abstract  = {Scheduling is one of the core links of modern industrial production. Scheduling needs to be designed according to the characteristics of the production line. In order to optimise the problem of workshop scheduling, the service-oriented programming idea and advanced technology to optimise the system development of mixed flow shop are adopted. The system is designed for applications in a distributed network environment. In this paper, an improved heuristic industrial production scheduling method is proposed to solve the scheduling system problem with multiple scheduling tasks, multiple processes, multiple stations, multiple constraints and rules. This method specifies the processing equipment, start time and completion time for each process of the production task. The application method shows that the proposed method can improve the automation and intelligence level of the scheduling process, improve the utilisation rate of equipment and other production resources, and give full play to the enterprise production capacity. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

  abstract  = {The production scheduling problem in hybrid flow shops is a complex combinatorial optimization problem observed in many real-world applications. The standard hybrid flow shop problem often involves unrealistic assumptions. In order to address the realistic assumptions, four additional traits were added to the proposed problem. These include the re-entrant line, setup times, position-dependent learning effects, and consideration of maximum completion time together with total tardiness as an objective function. Since the proposed problem is NP-hard, a meta-heuristic algorithm is proposed as the solution procedure. The solution procedure is categorized as an a priori approach. To show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, computational experiments were carried out on various test problems. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain an effective and appropriate solution quality for our investigated problem. © 2018 Sharif University of Technology.

  abstract   = {Scheduling in foundry consist a type of production where, the hot work-in-processes cannot wait between two successive operations and can be modeled as a flow shop scheduling problem with no-wait constraint. With the objective to reduce total flow time, the appropriate sequence of jobs for scheduling is essential, hence the problem can be observed as typical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. This paper, proposes hybridization of Particle Swarm Optimization with simulated annealing for planning and scheduling issues which are very complex because of the ever changing needs of customers and existing constraints in foundry. This Proposed Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm represents solution by random key representation rule for converting the continuous position information values of particles to a discrete job permutation. The proposed hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm initializes population efficiently with Nawaz-Enscore-Ham heuristic and uses evolutionary search guided by the mechanism of PSO and local search by mechanism of simulated Annealing by balancing both global exploration and local exploitation. The proposed hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm try to bridge the gap between theory and practice by considering foundry environment, which will help planner to decide the sequence of production of jobs based against clients' orders and to develop efficient scheduling procedures for minimizing total flow time with relatively low computational efforts. Extensive computational experiments are carried out based on various casting's (job's) characteristics viz. casting type, mould size and type of alloy, where size of job (n) considered as 10,12,20,50 and 100. With respect to performance measure, Average Relative Percent Deviation which is popular in the scheduling literature, the proposed method performs better than Simulated Annealing and Particle Swarm Optimization. © 2018 The Authors.

First, a proactive model is proposed to formulate the problem mathematically. Then, Monte Carlo sampling method is adopted to obtain the objective value for feasible solutions and a surrogate measure is proposed to approximate the objective function efficiently. Based on the sampling method and surrogate measure, a two-loop algorithm is devised to optimize the sequence of jobs, positions of preventive maintenances and idle times simultaneously. Computational results indicate that solution robustness and stability of quality robustness can be significantly improved using our algorithm compared with the solutions obtained by the traditional way. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract  = {This study deals with a hybrid flowshop system with sequence-dependent setup times. Two objectives have been considered. Minimizing makespan for production purpose along with minimizing unavailability of the system for maintenance purpose are the objectives of this problem. Two meta-heuristics have been developed for the research problem. First one is a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), while the second one is a hybridized NSGA-II (HNSGA-II), which is accompanied by a local search procedure to create better results. These two algorithms allow the decision maker to find compromise solutions between production objectives and preventive maintenance ones. Two decisions should be taken at the same time: finding the best assignment and sequence of jobs on machines in order to minimize the makespan, and deciding how often to perform preventive maintenance actions in order to minimize the system unavailability. Three approaches have been suggested for evaluation and comparison the efficiency of algorithms. The results indicate that the HNSGA-II presents better solutions compared to the ordinal NSGA-II in terms of objective functions viewpoint, while the results are obviously reversed in balance degree of achieving both objectives simultaneously. © 2017, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.},

  abstract  = {The permutation flow shop scheduling problem (PFSSP), one of the most widely studied production scheduling problems, is a typical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper, a hybrid harmony search algorithm with efficient job sequence mapping scheme and variable neighborhood search (VNS), named HHS, is proposed to solve the PFFSP with the objective to minimize the makespan. First of all, to extend the HHS algorithm to solve the PFSSP effectively, an efficient smallest order value (SOV) rule based on random key is introduced to convert continuous harmony vector into a discrete job permutation after fully investigating the effect of different job sequence mapping schemes. Secondly, an effective initialization scheme, which is based on NEH heuristic mechanism combining with chaotic sequence, is employed with the aim of improving the solution's quality of the initial harmony memory (HM). Thirdly, an opposition-based learning technique in the selection process and the best harmony (best individual) in the pitch adjustment process are made full use of to accelerate convergence performances and improve solution accuracy. Meanwhile, the parameter sensitivity is studied to investigate the properties of HHS, and the recommended values of parameters adopted in HHS are presented. Finally, by making use of a novel variable neighborhood search, the efficient insert and swap structures are incorporated into the HHS to adequately emphasize local exploitation ability. Experimental simulations and comparisons on both continuous and combinatorial benchmark problems demonstrate that the HHS algorithm outperforms the standard HS algorithm and other recently proposed efficient algorithms in terms of solution quality and stability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract   = {Design, production and installation of track slabs are critical technologies of high-speed rail which has become an important trend of the transportation development across the world. This paper mainly investigates the scheduling arrangements and optimization of precast production of track slabs. A Flow-Shop Multi-Objective Optimization Scheduling Model (FSMSM) has been developed and solved by a Hybrid Genetic and Ant Colony Algorithm (HGACA). Comparisons among HGACA, single Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Algorithm and classical heuristic rules show that the HGACA could obtain better schedules for the model. By means of co-scheduling factory production and engineering construction, scientific and efficient precast production has been promoted and management ability of the industry has been enhanced. It may help manufacturers save enterprise resource, reduce labor consumption, decrease inventory costs, enhance production flexibility and improve enterprise's Level of Service. © 2017 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {The development of more efficient and better performing priority dispatching rules (PDRs) for production scheduling is relevant to modern flow shop scheduling practice because they are simple, easy to apply and have low computational complexity, especially for large-scale problems. While the current research trend in scheduling is towards finding superior solutions through meta-heuristics, they are computationally expensive and many meta-heuristics also use PDRs to generate starting points. In this paper, we analyse the properties of flow shop scheduling problems to minimise maximum completion time, and generate a new dominance rule that is complementary to Szwarc’s rule. These dominance rules indicate that a weighting factor should be included in sequencing to account for the possibility that a single job’s processing time can generate idle time repeatedly within a flow line. Two new PDRs with a leveraged weighting factor are proposed to minimise makespan and average completion time. Computational results on Taillard’s benchmark problems and on historical operating room data show that the proposed PDRs perform much better than established PDRs without an increase in computational complexity. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

  abstract  = {Scheduling is one of the most important decisions in production control. An approach is proposed for supporting users to solve scheduling problems, by choosing the combination of physical manufacturing system configuration and the material handling system settings. The approach considers two alternative manufacturing scheduling configurations in a two stage product oriented manufacturing system, exploring the hybrid flow shop (HFS) and the parallel flow shop (PFS) environments. For illustrating the application of the proposed approach an industrial case from the automotive components industry is studied. The main aim of this research to compare results of study of production scheduling in the hybrid and the parallel flow, taking into account the makespan minimization criterion. Thus the HFS and the PFS performance is compared and analyzed, mainly in terms of the makespan, as the transportation times vary. The study shows that the performance HFS is clearly better when the work stations' processing times are unbalanced, either in nature or as a consequence of the addition of transport times just to one of the work station processing time but loses advantage, becoming worse than the performance of the PFS configuration when the work stations' processing times are balanced, either in nature or as a consequence of the addition of transport times added on the work stations' processing times. This means that physical layout configurations along with the way transport time are including the work stations' processing times should be carefully taken into consideration due to its influence on the performance reached by both HFS and PFS configurations.},

  abstract  = {This study investigates the simultaneous scheduling of production and planning of maintenance activities in the flow shop scheduling environment. The problem is considered in a bi-objective form, minimizing the makespan as the production scheduling criterion and minimizing the system unavailability as the maintenance planning criterion. We propose the coordinative production and maintenance scheduling model in which the time interval between consecutive maintenance activities as well as the number of maintenance activities on each machine are assumed to be non-fixed. The coordinative model aims to find the best permutation of jobs as the production problem and to assign the maintenance activities into the schedule as the maintenance problem, simultaneously. Moreover, a special setting called single server maintenance is introduced and discussed. A bi-objective ant colony system algorithm is presented to solve the problem in focus, introducing some novel ideas. CDS and NEH heuristics are applied to define the heuristic information part of the proposed algorithm. Some experiments are carried out to select the appropriate heuristic method between CDS and NEH. Moreover, some experiments are performed using the well-known Taillard benchmark, comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm with another ant colony optimization algorithm. Computational experiments indicate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Many production scheduling problems resemble flowshops and hence it has generated much interest and had a big impact in the field, resulting in literally hundreds of heuristic and metaheuristic methods over the last 60 years. However, most methods proposed for makespan minimisation are not properly compared with existing procedures so currently it is not possible to know which are the most efficient methods for the problem regarding the quality of the solutions obtained and the computational effort required. In this paper, we identify and exhaustively compare the best existing heuristics and metaheuristics so the state-of-the-art regarding approximate procedures for this relevant problem is established. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {The aim of this work is to bridge the gap between the theory and actual practice of production scheduling by studying a problem from a real-life production environment. This paper considers a practical Sanitaryware production system as a number of make-to-order permutation flowshop problems. Due to the wide range of variation in its products, real-time arrival of customer orders, dynamic batch adjustments, and time for machine setup, Sanitaryware production system is complex and also time sensitive. In practice, many such companies run with suboptimal solutions. To tackle this problem, in this paper, a memetic algorithm based real-time approach has been proposed. Numerical experiments based on real data are also been presented in this paper. © 2016 Cambridge University Press.},

  abstract   = {This paper gives insights on the usability of single priority and multi-criteria dispatching rules for production scheduling based on the results for a German chipboard manufacturing plant. A discrete-event simulation of the manufacturing process has been modeled to compare different priority rules with an expert-based sequence for a real set of jobs. The simulation results show that using one single or multi-criteria priority dispatching rule on the total production system basically leads to a poor performance, whereas using different rules for each machine will enhance the overall performance. Higher performance can be achieved by the expert-based scheduling and individual multi-criteria dispatching rules. Hence, a dynamic modification of the production schedule by switching the dispatching rules according to the current performance is proposed, considering unforeseen disturbances. © 2017 DEStech Publications.

The Model was a mixed integer quadratic that contains some integer and binary variables, so that analytic search solution could not be used for the model. It was developed a stepwise optimization method to solve the model. This model describes the trade-off between production cost and maintenance cost as the increasing of production run length on two machines.

  abstract  = {This work addresses the minimization of the makespan criterion for the permutation flow shop problem with blocking, sequence and machine dependent setup times, which is a problem that has not been studied in previous works. Many papers considered the problem with an unlimited buffer or with the setup time embedded in the processing time of the job. However, considering an unlimited buffer may not represent reality in many industries. Additionally, separating the setup time from the processing time allows greater flexibility for production scheduling, thus allowing better time usage and a reduction in the makespan. Two structural properties of the problem are presented: an upper bound for the machine idle time and a lower bound for the machine blocking time. Using these properties, four lower bounds for the makespan are proposed (LBTN1, LBTN2, LBTN3 and LBTN4). Each of the lower bounds was used in a branch-and-bound algorithm and then compared to each other using a database containing 540 problems. A MILP model is also presented and compared with the best of the branch-and-bound models using a second database that consists of 80 different problems. Computational tests are presented, and the comparisons indicate that the proposed lower bounds are promising. © 2017 The Author(s).

  abstract   = {Flow shop scheduling problem is a type of scheduling dealing with sequencing jobs on a set of machines in compliance with predetermined processing orders. Each production stage to be scheduled in typical flow shop scheduling contains only one machine. However, in automotive part industry, many parts are produced in sequential flow shop containing more than one machines in each production stage. This circumstance cannot apply the existing method of flow shop scheduling. The objective of this research is to schedule the production process of automotive parts. The feature production is hybrid flow shop which consists of two-stages. In each stage, there are several manufacturing machines and each machine can produce more than one product. Thus, production scheduling is a complex problem. This paper, therefore, develops mathematical model to solve the hybrid flow shop production scheduling under different constraints of each machine. The setup time and production time of each machine can be different for each part. The solution for the experimental data sets from an automotive part manufacturer reveals that the process time can be reduced by 34.29%. © ECMS Zita Zoltay Paprika, Péter Horák, Kata Váradi,Péter Tamás Zwierczyk, Ágnes Vidovics-Dancs, János Péter Rádics (Editors).},

  abstract  = {On-site renewable electricity generation represents an attractive option for manufacturing enterprises to deal with time varying electricity prices while reducing their carbon footprint. Production scheduling can be used to take full advantage of the installed renewable energy capacity for electricity cost reduction. A dynamic scheduling approach is proposed to minimize the electricity cost of a flow shop with a grid-integrated wind turbine. Time series models are used to provide updated wind speed and electricity prices as actual data becomes available. The production schedule and energy supply decisions are adjusted based on the new information. The approach is demonstrated using a case study. © 2017},

  abstract  = {Due to increasing energy requirements and associated environmental impacts, nowadays manufacturing companies are facing the emergent challenges to meet the demand of sustainable manufacturing. Most existing research on reducing energy consumption in production scheduling problems has focused on static scheduling models. However, there exist many unexpected disruptions like new job arrivals and machine breakdown in a real-world production scheduling. In this paper, it is proposed an approach to address the dynamic scheduling problem reducing energy consumption and makespan for a flexible flow shop scheduling. Since the problem is strongly NP-hard, a novel algorithm based on an improved particle swarm optimization is adopted to search for the Pareto optimal solution in dynamic flexible flow shop scheduling problems. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a new bi-objective mixed integer programming model for the two-stage assembly flow shop scheduling problem with preventive maintenance (PM) activities, in which the reliability/availability approach is employed to model the maintenance concepts of a problem. PM activities carry out the operations on machines and tools before the breakdown takes place. Therefore, it helps to prevent failures before they happen. After developing a new bi-objective model, an Epsilon-constraint method is proposed to solve the problem. This problem has been known as Np-hard. Therefore, three multi-objective optimization methods, namely fast non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, Multi-objective imperialist competitive algorithm, and non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm (NRGA) are employed to find the pareto-optimal front for large sized problems. The parameters of the proposed algorithms are calibrated using artificial neural network (ANN) and the performances of the proposed algorithms on the problems of various sizes are analyzed and the computational results reveal that NRGA outperform than two other proposed algorithms in quality of solutions and computational time. © 2016 Chinese Institute of Industrial Engineers.},

  abstract  = {One of the most important assumptions in production scheduling is permanent availability of the machines without any breakdown. In real-world scheduling problems, machines could be unavailable due to various reasons such as preventive maintenance and unpredicted breakdowns. In this paper, a flowshop scheduling problem under machine breakdown uncertainty is studied. The machines are subject to breakdown in practice caused by components’ wear-out. A proactive scheduling is considered to deal with unpredictable machine breakdown. An effective hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm based on genetic and simulated annealing algorithms is proposed to tackle such an NP-hard problem. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, its performance in terms of maximising the β-robustness of makespan was compared with six other heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms. Computational results confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms the others. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.},

  abstract  = {The permutation flow shop scheduling problem (PFSSP) is one of the most widely studied production scheduling problems and a typical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems as well. In this paper, a self-guided differential evolution with neighborhood search (NS-SGDE) is presented for the PFSSP with the objectives of minimizing the maximum completion time. Firstly, some constructive heuristics are incorporated into the discrete harmony search (DHS) algorithm to initialize the population. Secondly, a guided agent based on the probabilistic model is proposed to guide the DE-based exploration phase to generate the offspring. Thirdly, multiple mutation and crossover operations based on the guided agent are employed to explore more effective solutions. Fourthly, the neighborhood search based on the variable neighborhood search (VNS) is designed to further improve the search ability. Moreover, the convergence of NS-SGDE for PFSSP is analyzed according to the theory of Markov chain. Computational simulations and comparisons with some existing algorithms based on some widely used benchmark instances of the PFSSP are carried out, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NS-SGDE in solving the PFSSP. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract  = {This paper stablishes the model of the integrated batch planning process, and proposes an improved algorithm for this problem. The simulation results of a computerized scheduling system are given to prove the fitness of the model. The steel making casting production process scheduling problem is very difficult to get a good performance solution in practice. The scheduling of steelmaking casting production is a complicated problem of combinational optimization in the hybrid flow shop, which is an NP-Hard problem, and determining the polynomial time algorithm to arrive at the accurate optimal solution has proved to be a difficult task. An improved fuzzy genetic optimization and improved algorithm strategy are proposed. The results show that the method is very efficient in solving the steel casting production scheduling problem. © 2016 DAAAM International Vienna. All Rights Reserved.},

  abstract  = {This paper investigates an integrated optimisation problem of production scheduling and preventive maintenance (PM) in a two-machine flow shop with time to failure of each machine subject to a Weibull probability distribution. The objective is to find the optimal job sequence and the optimal PM decisions before each job such that the expected makespan is minimised. To investigate the value of integrated scheduling solution, computational experiments on small-scale problems with different configurations are conducted with total enumeration method, and the results are compared with those of scheduling without maintenance but with machine degradation, and individual job scheduling combined with independent PM planning. Then, for large-scale problems, four genetic algorithm (GA) based heuristics are proposed. The numerical results with several large problem sizes and different configurations indicate the potential benefits of integrated scheduling solution and the results also show that proposed GA-based heuristics are efficient for the integrated problem. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

  abstract   = {The Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (FSSP) is a problem that is commonly found by master production scheduling planners in Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS). The planner should find the optimal scheduling to carry out a set of jobs. All the jobs are processed in a production line composed of a set of shared machines. Furthermore, the jobs are processed in the same sequence. In order to be able to analyze this problem in a better way, this problem needs to be represented adequately for understanding the relationship among the operations that are carried out. Thus, an FMS presenting the FSSP can be modeled by Petri nets (PNs), which are a powerful tool that has been used to model and analyze discrete event systems. Then, the makespan can be obtained by simulating the PN through the token game animation. In this work, we propose an timed place PN to calculate the makespan of FSSP.},

  abstract   = {An integrated manufacturing/remanufacturing system is considered in this paper with the aim of scheduling the operations of the manufacturing plant. The system is partially closed in the sense that the raw materials, necessary for assembling the final products, can be obtained both from an internal remanufacturing plant (which disassembles returned products) and from external suppliers. The manufacturing system is modelled as a flexible flow shop whose stages represent the different assembly phases leading to the final products. In this paper, an original event-based mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation is presented, whose objective consists of minimizing, as primary objective, the weighted number of tardy jobs and, as secondary ones, the fixed and variable purchase costs of raw materials possibly acquired from external suppliers. Due to the complexity of the problem, the MIP formulation can be used to solve only small instances. For this reason, a matheuristics is proposed, which consists of three interoperating mathematical programming models: the first model assigns the jobs to the machines; the second model sequences the jobs on the machines; the third model defines the external supplies, taking into account the component availability constraints. A preliminary computational analysis shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved.},

  abstract   = {The machine utilisation remains one of the most important objectives of the production planning and scheduling. Although utilisation is a characteristics of a long term stochastic process and the makespan describes only a single deterministic schedule, in production scheduling models maximization of utilisation is usually approximated by makespan minimization. Presented analysis of typical production planning system and experimental results show that in permutation flow shop systems with unlimited buffers the impact of makespan minimization on long-term machine utilisation might be significantly overestimated. To bridge this gap between theory and practice a new measure of quality considering multiple schedules is proposed. © Copyright AGH-UST, Kraków, Polska, 2016.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA)-based memetic algorithm (MA) is proposed for solving the distributed assembly permutation flow-shop scheduling problem (DAPFSP) with the objective to minimize the maximum completion time. A novel bi-vector-based method is proposed to represent a solution for the DAPFSP. In the searching phase of the EDA-based MA (EDAMA), the EDA-based exploration and the local-search-based exploitation are incorporated within the MA framework. For the EDA-based exploration phase, a probability model is built to describe the probability distribution of superior solutions. Besides, a novel selective-enhancing sampling mechanism is proposed for generating new solutions by sampling the probability model. For the local-search-based exploitation phase, the critical path of the DAPFSP is analyzed to avoid invalid searching operators. Based on the analysis, a critical-path-based local search strategy is proposed to further improve the potential solutions obtained in the EDA-based searching phase. Moreover, the effect of parameter setting is investigated based on the Taguchi method of design-of-experiment. Suitable parameter values are suggested for instances with different scales. Finally, numerical simulations based on 1710 benchmark instances are carried out. The experimental results and comparisons with existing algorithms show the effectiveness of the EDAMA in solving the DAPFSP. In addition, the best-known solutions of 181 instances are updated by the EDAMA. © 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {Recently, power shortages have become a major problem all over Japan, due to the Great East Japan Earthquake, which resulted in the shutdown of a nuclear power plant. As a consequence, production scheduling has become a problem for factories, due to considerations of the availability of electric power. For factories, the contract with the electric power company sets the maximum power demand for a unit period, and in order to minimize this, it is necessary to consider the peak power when scheduling production. There are conventional studies on flowshop scheduling with consideration of peak power. However, these studies did not consider fluctuations in the processing time. Because the actual processing time is not constant, there is an increase in the probability of simultaneous operations with multiple machines. If the probability of simultaneous operations is high, the probability of increasing the peak power is high. Thus, we consider inserting idle time (delay in inputting parts) into the schedule in order to reduce the likelihood of simultaneous operations. We consider a robust schedule that limits the peak power, in spite of an unexpected fluctuation in the processing time. However, when we insert idle time, the makespan gets longer, and the production efficiency decreases. Therefore, we performed simulations to investigate the optimal amount of idle time and the best point for inserting it. We propose a more robust production scheduling model that considers random processing times and the peak power consumption. The results of experiments show that the effectiveness of the schedule produced by the proposed method is superior to the initial schedule and to a schedule produced by another method. Thus, the use of random processing times can limit the peak power. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {We address a novel integrated maintenance and production scheduling problem in a multi-machine and multi-period production system, considering maintenance as a long-term decision. Deterioration of machines over time decreases production capacity. Since maintenance activities not only improve machine conditions, increasing production capacity, but also take time that cannot be used for production, the challenge is to assign maintenance to periods and to schedule maintenance and production activities within each period to minimize the combined cost of maintenance and lost production over the planning horizon. Motivated by logic-based Benders decomposition, we design an integrated two-stage algorithm to solve the problem. The first stage assigns maintenance to machines and time periods, abstracting the scheduling problem, while the second stage creates a schedule for the current time period. The first stage is then re-solved using feedback from the schedule. This iteration between maintenance planning and scheduling continues until the solution costs in two stages converge. The integrated approach models the interdependencies between maintenance and scheduling decisions in highly coupled processes such as wafer fabrication in the semiconductor manufacturing. Our results demonstrate that the benefit of integrated decision making increases when maintenance is less expensive relative to lost production cost and that a longer horizon for maintenance planning is beneficial when maintenance cost increases. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract  = {This paper studies a synchronised scheduling problem of production simultaneity and shipment punctuality in a two-stage assembly flowshop system. Production simultaneity seeks to ensure all products belonging to a same customer order are simultaneously completed (at least as close as possible). Shipment punctuality attempts to satisfy orders individual shipment due dates. We provide two criteria, i.e. mean longest waiting duration and mean earliness and tardiness, for measuring production simultaneity and shipment punctuality, respectively. A synchronised scheduling model is developed by balancing the two criteria using linear weighted sum method. A modified genetic algorithm (GA) is then proposed for solving this model. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results indicate that considering production simultaneity can remarkably reduce finished products inventory. A prioritised weight combination interval for production simultaneity and shipment punctuality has been suggested. Production simultaneity is affected by the production system configuration, especially in peak seasons. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

  abstract  = {In today’s competitive world, each company which is involved in production activities should try to adjust its production scheduling with customers’ order. This reality was one of the principals of emerging just-in-time philosophy which tries to fulfill each customer’s order in exact size of his demand and at the earliest time which is preferred by him. This is the main reason why those industries which produce high variety of goods have been trying to change their production policy from batch production of a single type to batch production mixed of different types which is called minimal part set. With this motivation, cyclic policy which also attempts to reduce work-in-process inventory arouse in production systems. Although hybrid flow shop is one of the most important and notable problems in sequencing and scheduling, there has not yet been any research that considers use of cyclic policy in hybrid flow shop. This problem is which this paper tries to peruse. Moreover, we try to reduce the gap between theoretical and practical problems by considering unrelated parallel machines, eligibility, and limited buffer constraints. In this paper, a mixed integer linear programming model is proposed at first. Because of the NP-hard nature of the problem, some heuristics and meta-heuristics are proposed for solving the problem and are compared then. At last, all the results show that a simulated annealing method using some embedded heuristics in it is an effective approach for solving this problem. © 2014, Springer-Verlag London.},

  abstract   = {Utilization and work-in-process (WIP) inventories of flow lines are two managerial concerns in manufacturing systems. They relate to two objectives in flowshop production scheduling respectively. Minimization of maximum completion time relates to utilization improvement of flow lines, and minimization of average completion time relates to WIP inventory management. However, these two objectives are inconsistent, although maximum completion time is part of the average completion time. In this paper, we propose a novel objective for flowshop production and a state space with head, body and tail (SS-HBT) heuristic to balance such inconsistency between the two objectives. Through case studies, we show that our SS-HBT heuristic outperforms two well-established heuristics in flowshop production scheduling. © 2015 The Authors.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a multi-strategy ensemble artificial bee colony (MEABC) algorithm for solving large-scale production scheduling problem. MEABC is a new variant of artificial bee colony (ABC), which has shown good performance on many continuous optimisation problems. To apply MEABC to discrete production scheduling problem, the smallest position value (SPV) rule is employed. Moreover, a modified NEH-based population initialisation method is utilised for generating high-quality initial solutions. Experimental study is conducted on a set of 140 flow shop scheduling problems with the size from 20 × 5 to 2,000 × 100. Simulation results show that MEABC performs better than the NEH and ABC on all test instances. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

  abstract   = {Current computer network technologies would achieve highly-distributed manufacturing systems (HDMSs), where each computerized facility manages itself autonomously by communicating with other facilities. For HDMSs, we proposed a distributed scheduling method for flexible flow-shop production, where priority of each facility is updated with indirect decision making and information control performed by a communication protocol. This method is composed of processing flows for buffers and machines in production stages. The buffer performs time management in a stage and the machines in the same stage take actions based on the time managed by the buffer. This paper describes an improved method for job production, where no buffer exists and all machines play both roles as a buffer and a machine. In this method, all machines behave according to the processing flow obtained by integrating those for buffers and machines. This method was applied to a simple example and its feasibility was proven.},

  abstract   = {The steelmaking-continuous casting (SCC) process, which consists of steelmaking, refining and continuous casting stage, is usually the critical process in iron and steel industry. This paper aims to propose a simulation method for the realistic hybrid flow shop scheduling problem resulting from the SCC process. A mathematic model based on a comprehensive investigation is built first. Then, a simulation method which can decide the time scope of production materials on each stage in the simulation initialization is presented. Additionally, the matching decision algorithm is employed to match the machines and production materials in the simulation running process. To evaluate the simulation method, numerical experiments are conducted with an 8 hours test instance generated according to a real-world production process. The results show that the simulation method is a feasible and effective method for production scheduling in SCC process. © 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract   = {A production programming model is proposed through the application of a metaheuristic technique to achieve the reduction of the makespan. A company in the textile sector was chosen as a case study and a production programming methodology for hybrid-flexible flow shop configurations was developed with the coding of a simple genetic algorithm. The algorithm gives good quality results with very reasonable computational times and coefficients of variation of about 2% in relation to the values of the makespan. This model also shows a level of efficiency comparable to other applications found in the literature, in which evolutionary algorithms are used. It is concluded that from the encoding of the production system and its main restrictions, the genetic algorithm well performs production scheduling by reducing the makespan. © 2015, Centro de Informacion Tecnologica.

  abstract   = {The flexible flow-shop scheduling problem (FFSSP) is an important branch of production scheduling, the flexible flow shop is a combination of two well-known machine environments, which are flow shops and parallel machines, and it is well known that this problem is NP-hard. The no-wait requirement is a phenomenon that may occur in flow shops, and it's prevent the jobs to wait between two successive machines (or stages), jobs must be processed from the start to finish, without any interruption on machines (or stages) or between them. Many different approaches have been applied to FFSSP with no-wait. In this research, two-stage no-wait flexible flow shop scheduling problem (NWFFSSP) has been solved using two meta-heuristics, which are Tabu Search (TS) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We solved the NWFFSSP with minimum makespan as a performance measure. The performance of the proposed algorithms are studied and compared with previous research results using the same problem data. The results of the study proposes the effective algorithm. © 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract  = {For the flow-shops, where the machines' failure function is governed by the Weibull distribution, considering the maintenance strategy, a joint model of integrating run-based preventive maintenance (PM) and production scheduling is proposed under the uncertainty environment, in which the planned start times of jobs and the PM times are determined simultaneously. And, the makespan is selected as the quality robustness measure; the total delay of the jobs' start time is selected as the solution robustness measure. Then, a three-phase heuristic algorithm based on the priority list, surrogate measure, and local search is devised to solve the mathematic model. Experimental results demonstrate that the solution robustness can be significantly improved at the cost of very little degradation in quality robustness using our algorithm compared with the traditional way.

  abstract   = {Production scheduling plays a vital role in the planning and operation of a manufacturing system. Better scheduling system has a significant impact on cost reduction and minimum work-in-process inventory. This work considers the problem of scheduling n/m/F/ΣCi using Decision Tree (DT) algorithm. Since this problem is known to be strongly NP-hard, this work proposes heuristic based methodology to solve it. The advantages of DT’s are that the dispatching rule is in the form of If-then else rules which are easily understandable by the shop floor people. The proposed approach is tested on benchmark problems available in the literature and compared. The proposed work is a complement to the traditional methods. © 2015, Strojarski Facultet.

  abstract  = {Scheduling ‘n’ jobs on ‘m’ machines in a flow shop is NP- hard problem and places itself at prominent place in the area of production scheduling. The essence of any scheduling algorithm is to minimize the makespan in a flowshop environment. In this paper an attempt has been made to develop a heuristic algorithm, based on the reduced weightage of ma-chines at each stage to generate different combination of ‘m-1’ sequences. The proposed heuristic has been tested on several benchmark problems of Taillard (1993) [Taillard, E. (1993). Benchmarks for basic scheduling problems. European Journal of Operational Research, 64, 278-285.]. The performance of the proposed heuristic is compared with three well-known heuristics, namely Palmer’s heuristic, Campbell’s CDS heuristic, and Dannenbring’s rapid access heuristic. Results are evaluated with the best-known upper-bound solutions and found better than the above three. © 2014 Growing Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},
